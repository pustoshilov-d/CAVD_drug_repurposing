35571096	Atractylenolide-1 (AT-1), a natural active ingredient extracted from a, was reported to have good anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Osteogenic changes induced by the inflammation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) play a role in the development of calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). This study aimed to investigate the anti-osteogenic effects of AT-1 in human VICs. Human VICs were exposed to osteogenic induction medium (OM) containing AT-1 to analyze cell viability, as well as protein and osteogenic gene expression. Anti-calcification tests were also performed. mRNA transcriptome sequencing was performed to identify differential genes and pathways regulated by AT-1. Western blotting was used to verify the enrichment pathway, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was conducted to identify drug targets. Finally, molecular docking and inhibitors are used to verify the drug targets. Treatment of VICs with 20 \xce\xbcM AT-1 resulted in no significant cytotoxicity. The addition of AT-1 to OM prevented the accumulation of calcified nodules, and decreases in the level of (Alkaline Phosphatase) ALP and RUNX2 gene and protein expression were observed. Atractylenolide-1 can target FLT3 protein and inhibit the phosphorylation of FLT3, thereby blocking PI3K/AKT pathway activation, reducing the production of Hypoxia inducible factor(HIF)1-\xce\xb1, and inhibiting the osteogenic differentiation of VICs. These results suggest AT-1 as a potential drug for treating calcified aortic valve disease.
35433352	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an active pathobiological process that takes place at the cellular and molecular levels. It involves fibrosis and calcification of aortic valve leaflets, which eventually contributes to heart failure. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a \xce\xb2-galactoside-binding lectin, is involved in myocardial fibrosis and remodeling. Our study aimed to explore how Gal-3 promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hVICs) along with elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms.
35417712	Cellular heterogeneity of aortic valves complicates the mechanistic evaluation of the calcification processes in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), and animal disease models are lacking. In this study, we identify a disease-driver population (DDP) within valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Through stepwise single-cell analysis, phenotype-guided omic profiling, and network-based analysis, we characterize the DDP fingerprint as CD44 and discover potential key regulators of human CAVD. These DDP-VICs demonstrate multi-lineage differentiation and osteogenic properties. Temporal proteomic profiling of DDP-VICs identifies potential targets for therapy, including MAOA and CTHRC1. In vitro loss-of-function experiments confirm our targets. Such a stepwise strategy may be advantageous for therapeutic target discovery in other disease contexts.
35409134	Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a key regulator of calcium, phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. Although it has been reported that aortic valve calcification was positively associated with PTH, the pathophysiological mechanisms and the direct effects of PTH on human valvular cells remain unclear. Here we investigated if PTH induces human valvular endothelial cells (VEC) dysfunction that in turn could impact the switch of valvular interstitial cells (VIC) to an osteoblastic phenotype. Human VEC exposed to PTH were analyzed by qPCR, western blot, Seahorse, ELISA and immunofluorescence. Our results showed that exposure of VEC to PTH affects VEC metabolism and functions, modifications that were accompanied by the activation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and by an increased expression of osteogenic molecules (BMP-2, BSP, osteocalcin and Runx2). The impact of dysfunctional VEC on VIC was investigated by exposure of VIC to VEC secretome, and the results showed that VIC upregulate molecules associated with osteogenesis (BMP-2/4, osteocalcin and TGF-\xce\xb21) and downregulate collagen I and III. In summary, our data show that PTH induces VEC dysfunction, which further stimulates VIC to differentiate into a pro-osteogenic pathological phenotype related to the calcification process. These findings shed light on the mechanisms by which PTH participates in valve calcification pathology and suggests that PTH and the treatment of hyperparathyroidism represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce valvular calcification.
35397552	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most commonly valvular disease in the western countries initiated by inflammation and abnormal calcium deposition. Currently, there is no clinical drug for CAVD. Neutrophil elastase (NE) plays a causal role in inflammation and participates actively in cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of NE on valve calcification remains unclear. So we next explore whether it is involved in valve calcification and the molecular mechanisms involved.
35367413	Recent genome-wide association and transcriptome-wide association studies have identified an association between the PALMD locus, encoding palmdelphin, a protein involved in myoblast differentiation, and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Nevertheless, the function and underlying mechanisms of PALMD in CAVD remain unclear. We herein investigated whether and how PALMD affects the pathogenesis of CAVD using clinical samples from CAVD patients and a human valve interstitial cell (hVIC) in vitro calcification model. We showed that PALMD was upregulated in calcified regions of human aortic valves and calcified hVICs. Furthermore, silencing of PALMD reduced hVIC in vitro calcification, osteogenic differentiation, and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of PALMD had the opposite effect. RNA-Seq of PALMD-depleted hVICs revealed that silencing of PALMD reduced glycolysis and nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB (NF-\xce\xbaB)-mediated inflammation in hVICs and attenuated tumor necrosis factor \xce\xb1-induced monocyte adhesion to hVICs. Having established the role of PALMD in hVIC glycolysis, we examined whether glycolysis itself could regulate hVIC osteogenic differentiation and inflammation. Intriguingly, the inhibition of PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis significantly attenuated osteogenic differentiation and inflammation of hVICs. However, silencing of PFKFB3 inhibited PALMD-induced hVIC inflammation, but not osteogenic differentiation. Finally, we showed that the overexpression of PALMD enhanced hVIC osteogenic differentiation and inflammation, as opposed to glycolysis, through the activation of NF-\xce\xbaB. The present study demonstrates that the genome-wide association- and transcriptome-wide association-identified CAVD risk gene PALMD may promote CAVD development through regulation of glycolysis and NF-\xce\xbaB-mediated inflammation. We propose that targeting PALMD-mediated glycolysis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating CAVD.
35331838	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most frequent pathogeny of aortic valve replacement in developed countries. Iron deposits are found in the intraleaflet hemorrhage (IH) areas of calcific aortic valves. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that involves metabolic dysfunction resulting from iron overload-dependent excessive lipid peroxidation. In this study, histological analysis showed that ferroptosis occurs in the IH areas of calcific aortic valves. We also demonstrated that Slc7a11 is expressed at low levels in OM-treated valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and IH areas and that low Slc7a11 expression is associated with calcification in CAVD. However, iron overload treatment did not promote VIC calcification under osteogenic conditions in vitro. Using lentiviral transfection to knockdown Slc7a11 in VICs, we found that the degree of iron overload-induced ferroptosis was positively increased in vitro. Finally, we also found that Slc7a11 knockdown promoted the osteogenic differentiation of VICs in vitro. In summary, this study reports a novel mechanism linking ferroptosis and CAVD development in which iron may promote Slc7a11-deficient VIC osteogenic differentiation by aggravating ferroptosis in vitro, thereby accelerating the progression of aortic valve calcification.
35318164	Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a cardiovascular disease with increasing morbidity and mortality. The pathogenetic cellular mechanism is the phenotypic transition of aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs). Here, we explored the effect of berberine (BBR) on the phenotypic transition of VICs and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms, providing a theoretical basis in finding novel clinical treatments for CAVD.
35299058	Activated innate immune cells infiltrating the valve and their secreted cytokines drive the differentiation of valve interstitial cells into myofibroblastic and osteoblastic phenotypes in calcified aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). In this study, we investigated how NLRP3 inhibition with CY-09 reduces aortic valve stenosis and calcification.
35289986	3D heterogeneous and anisotropic scaffolds that approximate native heart valve tissues are indispensable for the successful construction of tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs). In this study, novel tri-layered and gel-like nanofibrous scaffolds, consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and poly(aspartic acid) (PASP), are fabricated by a combination of positive/negative conjugate electrospinning and bioactive hydrogel post-processing. The nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds present tri-layered structures, resulting in anisotropic mechanical properties that are comparable with native heart valve leaflets. Biological tests show that nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds with high PASP ratios significantly promote the proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) secretions of human aortic valvular interstitial cells (HAVICs), compared to PLGA scaffolds. Importantly, the nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds are found to effectively inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of HAVICs. Two types of porcine VICs, from young and adult age groups, are further seeded onto the PLGA-PASP scaffolds. The adult VICs secrete higher amounts of collagens and GAGs and undergo a significantly higher level of osteogenic differentiation than young VICs. RNA sequencing analysis indicates that age has a pivotal effect on the VIC behaviors. This study provides important guidance and a reference for the design and development of 3D tri-layered, gel-like nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds for TEHV applications.
35282345	We aim to analyse sex-specific differences in aortic valves (AVs) and valve interstitial cells (VICs) from aortic stenosis (AS) patients.
35238312	Aortic valve stenosis (AS) disease is the most common valvular disease in developed countries. The pathology of AS is complex, and its main processes include calcification of the valve stroma and involve genetic factors, lipoprotein deposition and oxidation, chronic inflammation, osteogenic transition of cardiac valve interstitial cells, and active valve calcification. The aim of this study was to identify potential genes associated with AS.
35190902	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common valve disease characterized by the fibro-calcific remodeling of the aortic valves, which is an actively regulated process involving osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). MicroRNA (miRNA) is an essential regulator in diverse biological processes in cells. The present study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of miR-22 in the osteogenic differentiation of VICs. The expression profile of osteogenesis-related miRNAs was first detected in aortic valve tissue from CAVD patients (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 12). miR-22 was highly expressed in calcified valve tissues (P  = 0.563, P < 0.01) in VICs isolated from mild or moderately calcified valves. The sustained high expression of miR-22 was also validated in an in-vitro VICs osteogenic model. Adenovirus-mediated gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were then performed. Overexpression of miR-22 significantly accelerated the calcification process of VICs, manifested by significant increases in calcium deposition, alkaline phosphate activity, and expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers. Conversely, inhibition of miR-22 significantly negated the calcification process. Subsequently, calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39) was identified as a target of miR-22. Overexpression of miR-22 significantly reduced the expression of CAB39 in VICs, leading to decreased catalytic activity of the CAB39-LKB1-STRAD complex, which, in turn, exacerbated changes in the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, and ultimately accelerated the calcification process. In addition, ROS generation and autophagic activity during VIC calcification were also regulated by miR-22/CAB39 pathway. These results indicate that miR-22 is an important accelerator of the osteogenic differentiation of VICs, and a potential therapeutic target in CAVD.
35109802	Human aortic valve interstitial cells (hAVICs) are a key factor in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). This research examines the role and mechanism of microRNA miR-138-5p in osteogenic differentiation of hAVICs.
35074856	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an active pathological process mediated by abnormal activation and transdifferentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). The present study aims to investigate the function and underlying mechanism of the basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) on osteogenic differentiation of VICs. Porcine VICs cultured with osteogenic induction medium are supplemented with or without BFGF. Morphology of VICs is identified by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, the cell viability is assessed by the cell counting kit-8 method, and protein and mRNA expression level of osteogenic differentiation markers, including Runx2, osteopontin, and Sp7, are verified by western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. RNA sequencing is used to identify changes in gene profiles. Alizarin Red S staining is used to measure calcium deposition. The results demonstrate that the content of calcium deposition and the expression level of osteogenic markers are downregulated by supplementing BFGF. Notch1 signaling pathway is extracted as a candidate target after bioinformatics analysis by RNA sequencing. The transfection of si-Notch1 abolishes the calcification inhibitory effect of BFGF. Taken together, our findings shed the light on the mechanism and potential therapeutics of BFGF for CAVD.
34914964	Calcification of the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) involves differential expression of various RNA genes, which is achieved through complex regulatory networks that are controlled in part by transcription factors and microRNAs. We previously found that miR-195-5p regulates the osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by targeting the TGF-\xce\xb2 pathway. However, the transcriptional regulation of miR-195-5p in calcified BAV patients is not yet clear. In this study, stenotic aortic valve tissues from patients with BAVs and tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs) were collected. Candidate transcription factors of miR-195-5p were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and tested in diseased valves and in male porcine VICs. SP2 gene expression and the corresponding protein levels in BAV were significantly lower than those in TAV, and a low SP2 expression level environment in VICs resulted in remarkable increases in RNA expression levels of RUNX2, BMP2, collagen 1, MMP2, and MMP9 and the corresponding proteins. ChIP assays revealed that SP2 directly bound to the transcription promoter region of miR-195-5p. Cotransfection of SP2 shRNA and a miR-195-5p mimic in porcine VICs demonstrated that SP2 repressed SMAD7 expression via miR-195-5p, while knockdown of SP2 increased the mRNA expression of SMAD7 and the corresponding protein and attenuated Smad 2/3 expression. Immunofluorescence staining of diseased valves confirmed that the functional proteins of osteogenesis differentiation, including RUNX2, BMP2, collagen 1, and osteocalcin, were overexpressed in BAVs. In Conclusion, the transcription factor Sp2 is expressed at low levels in VICs from BAV patients, which has a negative impact on miR-195-5p expression by binding its promoter region and partially promotes calcification through a SMAD-dependent pathway.
34254733	Functional tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) have been an elusive goal for nearly 30 years. Among the persistent challenges are the requirements for engineered valve leaflets that possess nonlinear elastic tissue biomechanical properties, support quiescent fibroblast phenotype, and resist osteogenic differentiation. Nanocellulose is an attractive tunable biological material that has not been employed to this application. In this study, we fabricated a series of photocrosslinkable composite hydrogels mNCC-MeGel (mNG) by conjugating TEMPO-modified nanocrystalline cellulose (mNCC) onto the backbone of methacrylated gelatin (MeGel). Their structures were characterized by FTIR,  HNMR and uniaxial compression testing. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) were encapsulated within the material and evaluated for valve interstitial cell phenotypes over 14 days culture in both normal and osteogenic media. Compared to the MeGel control group, the HADMSC encapsulated within mNG showed decreased alpha smooth muscle actin (\xce\xb1SMA) expression and increased vimentin and aggrecan expression, suggesting the material supports a quiescent fibroblastic phenotype. Under osteogenic media conditions, HADMSC within mNG hydrogels showed lower expression of osteogenic genes, including Runx2 and osteocalcin, indicating resistance toward calcification. As a proof of principle, the mNG hydrogel, combined with a viscosity enhancing agent, was used to 3D bioprint a tall, self-standing tubular structure that sustained cell viability. Together, these results identify mNG as an attractive biomaterial for TEHV applications.
34895136	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent valvular disease worldwide. However, no effective treatment could delay or prevent the progression of the disease due to the poor understanding of its pathological mechanism. Many studies showed that metformin exerted beneficial effects on multiple cardiovascular diseases by mediating multiple proteins such as AMPK, NF-\xce\xbaB, and AKT. This study aims to verify whether metformin can inhibit aortic calcification through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
34766179	Cardamonin (CDM) is a natural chalcone with strong anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation-induced osteogenic changes in valve interstitial cells (VICs) play crucial roles in the development of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), a degenerative disease characterized by degeneration, thickening, fibrosis, and calcification of the heart valve tissues. To investigate the anti-osteogenic differentiation role of CDM in human valve interstitial cells (hVICs), which consequently reverses the calcification of the aortic valve, human VICs were exposed to osteogenic induction medium (OM) with CDM for further cell viability, osteogenic gene and protein expression analyses, and anti-calcification testing. mRNA sequencing was utilized to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and related signaling pathways as potential molecular targets involved in CDM\'s anti-calcification activity. Human aortic valve leaflet , CDM ameliorated aortic valve calcification by interfering with NLRP3 expression. Our study demonstrated that CDM inhibited the phenotypical calcific transformation of hVICs by mediating the inactivation of the NF-\xce\xbaB/NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, it is considered to be a promising natural compound for use in preventing the progression of heart valve calcification disease.
34745206	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common structural heart disease, and the morbidity is increased with elderly population. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to play crucial roles in CAVD, and numerous miRNAs are still waiting to be explored. In this study, the miRNA expression signature in CAVD was analyzed unbiasedly by miRNA-sequencing, and we found that, compared with the normal control valves, 152 miRNAs were upregulated and 186 miRNAs were downregulated in calcified aortic valves. The functions of these differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with cell differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion and immune response processes. Among downregulated miRNAs, the expression level of miR-139-5p was negatively correlated with the osteogenic gene  the Wnt/\xce\xb2-Catenin pathway, which may further provide a new therapeutic target for CAVD.
34740021	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is caused by the initiation of the thickening and calcification of valve leaflets by valve interstitial cells (VICs). Cell metabolic changes during the CAVD process are a new field of basic research on this disease. The present study aimed to investigate whether andrographolide (AGP) could attenuate the calcification of aortic valves by regulating cell metabolism. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) metabolome analysis was utilized to investigate the changes in the metabolites of VICs from healthy and CAVD samples. Cell growth and the osteogenic differentiation of human VICs (hVICs) were assessed using a CCK8 assay and Alizarin Red S staining, respectively. The expression of two calcification-related markers, RUNX2 and ALP, was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining. Molecular docking was used to detect the interaction between AGP and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL). The high-fat-fed ApoE-/- mice aortic valve calcification animal model was used to verify the effect of AGP on CAVD in vivo. Metabolome analysis showed that the metabolites of VICs from healthy and CAVD samples were highly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycerolipid metabolism. The top six highlighted metabolites were selected to reveal a high regulation of lipids in VICs from CAVD. AGP significantly suppressed the calcific differentiation of VICs while it decreased the accumulation of the above six metabolites, 1-monopalmitic, palmitic acid, glycerol, l-asparagine, tetraethylene glycol, and stearic acid induced by osteogenic medium (OM) stimulation. These metabolites were highly correlated with the calcific marker ALP and showed a positive correlation with CAVD. In the comprehensive assessment, MGLL, associated with glycerol synthesis, was selected as the molecular target of AGP in inhibiting the calcific phenotype of transforming hVICs. The in vivo results revealed that AGP visibly ameliorated aortic valve calcification by reducing Von Kossa and ALP staining, which was positively correlated with MGLL expression. AGP ameliorated aortic valve calcification by regulating lipid biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism targeting MGLL expression in vitro and in vivo. It is a potent therapeutic supplement that prevents the occurrence of heart valve calcification disease by regulating cell metabolism.
34527708	The presented work demonstrates that radiation exposure enhances the calcific response in VICs, a hallmark of CAVD. In addition, high radiation exposure induces differentiation of VICs into a terminally differentiated giant-cell fibroblast. Further studies are essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these radiation-induced valvular changes.
34352088	Recent studies have shown that the choline-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a biomarker that promotes cardiovascular disease through the induction of inflammation and stress. Inflammatory responses and stress are involved in the progression of calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). Here, we examined whether TMAO induces the osteogenic differentiation of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress pathways in vitro and in vivo.
34243610	In calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), the valve interstitial cells (VIC) osteogenic phenotype changes can lead to thickening and calcification of the valve leaflets\xef\xbc\x8ceventually lead to restricted valve movement and life-threatening. This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of dihydrotanshinone I (DHI) on osteogenic medium (OM) induced osteogenic phenotypic transition of porcine valve interstitial cells (PVICs), which can provide theoretical and scientific basis for clinical intervention in CAVD.
34229104	Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a common, lethal cardiovascular disease. There is no cure except the valve replacement at last stage. Therefore, an understanding of the detail mechanism is imperative to prevent and intervene AS. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is one of the major risk factors of AS whereas fructose overconsuming tops the list of MetS risk factors. However, whether the fructose under physiological level induces AS is currently unknown.
34204737	Despite the great progress in the field of bone tissue regeneration, the early initiating mechanisms of osteogenic differentiation are not well understood. Cells capable of osteogenic transformation vary from mesenchymal stem cells of various origins to mural cells of vessels. The mechanisms of pathological calcification are thought to be similar to those of bone formation. Notch signaling has been shown to play an important role in osteogenic differentiation, as well as in pathological calcification. Nevertheless, despite its known tissue- and context-specificity, the information about its role in the osteogenic differentiation of different cells is still limited. We compared mesenchymal stem cells from adipogenic tissue (MSCs) and interstitial cells from the aortic valve (VICs) by their ability to undergo Notch-dependent osteogenic differentiation. We showed differences between the two types of cells in their ability to activate the expression of proosteogenic genes  promoters shows fine-tuned dose-dependency in response to Notch induction and suggests a direct link between the level of Notch activation, and the proostogenic gene expression and corresponding osteogenic induction. Our data suggest that osteogenic differentiation is a context-dependent process and the outcome of it could be cell-type dependent.
34043161	Little is known about the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 in degenerative calcified aortic valve disease (DCAVD). This study aims to explore whether AFAP1-AS1 regulates macrophage polarization in aortic valve calcification. Macrophage polarization and AFAP1-AS1 expression were detected in normal and calcified aortic valves of DCAVD patients. To explore the effect of AFAP1-AS1 on macrophage polarization, gain and loss of function were performed in THP-1 cells, and the percentage of M1 and M2 and the expressions of M1 and M2 markers were analyzed. Meanwhile, osteogenic differentiation was examined in valve interstitial cells (VICs). Compared with normal valves, there were more M1, less M2, and high AFAP1-AS1 expressions in calcified aortic valves, which may indicate a relationship between AFAP1-AS1 and macrophage polarization. AFAP1-AS1 overexpression promoted M1 polarization in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFN-\xce\xb3)-treated THP-1 cells but inhibited M2 polarization, as well as augmented VIC osteogenic differentiation. On the contrary, the silence of AFAP1-AS1 could induce macrophage to M2-type and inhibit VIC osteogenic differentiation. These results elucidate that AFAP1-AS1 can promote M1 macrophages polarization to aggravate VIC osteogenic differentiation, playing a role in aortic valve calcification.
33938898	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is present in nearly a third of the elderly population. Thickening, stiffening, and calcification of the aortic valve causes aortic stenosis and contributes to heart failure and stroke. Disease pathogenesis is multifactorial, and stresses such as inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, turbulent flow, and mechanical stress and strain contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of valve endothelial and valve interstitial cells. However, the precise initiating factors that drive the osteogenic transition of a healthy cell into a calcifying cell are not fully defined. Further, the only current therapy for CAVD-induced aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement, whereby the native valve is removed (surgical aortic valve replacement, SAVR) or a fully collapsible replacement valve is inserted via a catheter (transcatheter aortic valve replacement, TAVR). These surgical procedures come at a high cost and with serious risks; thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets for drug discovery is imperative. To that end, the present study develops a workflow where surgically removed tissues from patients and donor cadaver tissues are used to create patient-specific primary lines of valvular cells for in vitro disease modeling. This protocol introduces the utilization of a cold storage solution, commonly utilized in organ transplant, to reduce the damage caused by the often-lengthy procurement time between tissue excision and laboratory processing with the benefit of greatly stabilizing cells of the excised tissue. The results of the present study demonstrate that isolated valve cells retain their proliferative capacity and endothelial and interstitial phenotypes in culture upwards of several days after valve removal from the donor. Using these materials allows for the collection of control and CAVD cells, from which both control and disease cell lines are established.
33920891	Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a heart disease characterized by the progressive fibro-calcific remodeling of the aortic valves, an actively regulated process with the involvement of the reactive oxygen species-mediated differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) into osteoblast-like cells. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of a variety of antioxidant genes, and plays a protective role in valve calcification. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an Nrf2-target gene, is upregulated in human calcified aortic valves. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Nrf2/HO-1 axis in VIC calcification. We induced osteogenic differentiation of human VICs with elevated phosphate and calcium-containing osteogenic medium (OM) in the presence of heme. Heme inhibited Ca deposition and OM-induced increase in alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin (OCN) expression. Heme induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in VICs. Heme lost its anti-calcification potential when we blocked transcriptional activity Nrf2 or enzyme activity of HO-1. The heme catabolism products bilirubin, carbon monoxide, and iron, and also ferritin inhibited OM-induced Ca deposition and OCN expression in VICs. This study suggests that heme-mediated activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway inhibits the calcification of VICs. The anti-calcification effect of heme is attributed to the end products of HO-1-catalyzed heme degradation and ferritin.
33744308	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common progressive disease of the aortic valves, for which no medical treatment exists and surgery represents currently the only therapeutic solution. The development of novel pharmacological treatments for CAVD has been hampered by the lack of suitable test-systems, which require the preservation of the complex valve structure in a mechanically and biochemical controllable system. Therefore, we aimed at establishing a model which allows the study of calcification in intact mouse aortic valves by using the Miniature Tissue Culture System (MTCS), an ex vivo flow model for whole mouse hearts. Aortic valves of wild-type mice were cultured in the MTCS and exposed to osteogenic medium (OSM, containing ascorbic acid, \xce\xb2-glycerophosphate and dexamethasone) or inorganic phosphates (PI). Osteogenic calcification occurred in the aortic valve leaflets that were cultured ex vivo in the presence of PI, but not of OSM. In vitro cultured mouse and human valvular interstitial cells calcified in both OSM and PI conditions, revealing in vitro-ex vivo differences. Furthermore, endochondral differentiation occurred in the aortic root of ex vivo cultured mouse hearts near the hinge of the aortic valve in both PI and OSM conditions. Dexamethasone was found to induce endochondral differentiation in the aortic root, but to inhibit calcification and the expression of osteogenic markers in the aortic leaflet, partly explaining the absence of calcification in the aortic valve cultured with OSM. The osteogenic calcifications in the aortic leaflet and the endochondral differentiation in the aortic root resemble calcifications found in human CAVD. In conclusion, we have established an ex vivo calcification model for intact wild-type murine aortic valves in which the initiation and progression of aortic valve calcification can be studied. The in vitro-ex vivo differences found in our studies underline the importance of ex vivo models to facilitate pre-clinical translational studies.
33579497	In this study, electrospun scaffolds were fabricated by blending poly(l-lactide-co-\xce\xb5-caprolactone) (PLCL) and silk fibroin (SF) with different ratios, and further the feasibility of electrospun PLCL/SF scaffolds were evaluated for application of tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the surface of PLCL/SF electrospun scaffolds was smooth and uniform while the mechanical properties were appropriate as valve prosthesis. In vitro cytocompatibility evaluation results demonstrated that all of the PLCL/SF electrospun scaffolds were cytocompatible and valvular interstitial cells (VICs) cultured on PLCL/SF scaffolds of 80/20 & 70/30 ratios exhibited the best cytocompatibility. The in vitro osteogenic differentiation of VICs including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays indicated that PLCL/SF scaffolds of 80/20 & 90/10 ratios behaved better anti-calcification ability. In the in vivo calcification evaluation model of rat subdermal implantation, PLCL/SF scaffolds of 80/20 & 90/10 ratios presented better anti-calcification ability, which was consistent with the in vitro results. Moreover, PLCL/SF scaffolds of 80/20 & 70/30 ratios showed significantly enhanced cell infiltration and M2 macrophage with higher CD206+/CD68+ ratio. Collectively, our data demonstrated that electrospun scaffolds with the PLCL/SF ratio of 80/20 hold great potential as TEHV materials.
33482604	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an actively regulated degenerative disease process. Clinical lesions exhibit marked 3D complexity not represented in current in vitro systems. We here present a unique mechanically stressed 3D culture system that recapitulates valve interstitial cell (VIC) induced matrix calcification through myofibroblastic activation and osteoblastic differentiation. We test the hypothesis that valve endothelial (VEC) - interstitial collaborative interactions modulate the risk and complexity of calcific pathogenesis within mechanically stressed and pro-inflammatory environments.
33184978	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease in adults. The cellular mechanisms of CAVD are still unknown, but accumulating evidence has revealed that osteogenic differentiation of human valve interstitial cells (hVICs) plays an important role in CAVD. Thus, we aimed to investigate the function of estrogen-related receptor \xce\xb1 (ERR\xce\xb1) in the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs. We found that the level of ERR\xce\xb1 was significantly increased in CAVD samples compared to normal controls. In addition, ERR\xce\xb1 was significantly upregulated during hVIC osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to identify the function of ERR\xce\xb1 in hVIC calcification in vitro. Inhibition of endogenous ERR\xce\xb1 attenuated hVIC calcification, whereas overexpression of ERR\xce\xb1 in hVICs promoted this process. RNA sequencing results suggested that heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) was a downstream target of ERR\xce\xb1, which was further confirmed by western blotting. Additionally, we also found that downregulation of Hmox1 by shHmox1 efficiently reversed the inhibition of calcification induced by ERR\xce\xb1 shRNA in hVICs. ChIP-qPCR and luciferase assays indicated that Hmox1 was negatively regulated by ERR\xce\xb1. We found that overexpression of Hmox1 or its substrates significantly inhibited hVIC calcification in vitro. In conclusion, we found that knockdown of ERR\xce\xb1 can inhibit hVIC calcification through upregulating Hmox1 and that ERR\xce\xb1 and Hmox1 are potential targets for the treatment of CAVD.
33070258	Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by valve thickening and calcification. Osteoblast differentiation is one of the key steps of valve calcification. CircRNAs is involved in osteogenic differentiation of multiple mesenchymal cells. However, the function of circRNA TGFBR2 (TGFBR2) in CAVD remained unclear. We explored the effect and mechanism of TGFBR2 in modulating CAVD.
32259211	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common heart valve disease in the Western world. It has been reported that zinc is accumulated in calcified human aortic valves. However, whether zinc directly regulates CAVD is yet to be elucidated. The present study sought to determine the potential role of zinc in the pathogenesis of CAVD.
31924353	Aortic valve interstitial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis. In response to proinflammatory stimuli, aortic valve interstitial cells undergo an osteogenic phenotypic change. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effects of statins prevent osteogenic activity in cultured aortic valve interstitial cells.
31761339	Human aortic valve interstitial cells redifferentiate into an osteoblast-like phenotype, which is the key cellular mechanism of aortic valve calcification. Methyltransferase-like 3, the N6-methyladenosine methylation writer, has emerged as a new layer of epigenetic regulation for osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells. The current study sought to determine whether methyltransferase-like 3 also plays a role in the osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells.
33251046	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common heart valve disease in aging populations, and aberrant osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ectopic ossification of the aortic valve. miR-214 has been validated to be involved in the osteogenesis process. Here, we aim to investigate the role and mechanism of miR-214 in CAVD progression. miR-214 expression was significantly downregulated in CAVD aortic valve leaflets, accompanied by upregulation of osteogenic markers. Overexpression of miR-214 suppressed osteogenic differentiation of VICs, while silencing the expression of miR-214 promoted this function. miR-214 directly targeted ATF4 and Sp7 to modulate osteoblastic differentiation of VICs, which was proved by dual luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiment. miR-214 knockout rats exhibited higher mean transvalvular velocity and gradient. The expression of osteogenic markers in aortic valve leaflets of miR-214 knockout rats was upregulated compared to that of the wild-type group. Taken together, our study showed that miR-214 inhibited aortic valve calcification via regulating osteogenic differentiation of VICs by directly targeting ATF4 and Sp7, indicating that miR-214 may act as a profound candidate of targeting therapy for CAVD.
33173427	Our data suggest that IL-21 is a key factor in valve calcification and a promising candidate for targeted therapeutics for CAVD.
32982764	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), a common heart valve disease, is increasingly prevalent worldwide and causes high morbidity and mortality. Here, we aimed to investigate a possible role for miR-34c in the development of osteogenic differentiation during CAVD and to find out the underlying mechanisms. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) were isolated from the clinical aortic valve tissue samples of CAVD patients and patients with acute aortic dissection and collected. Then, RT-qPCR was performed to determine miR-34c expression and western blot analysis was applied to confirm the relevant protein expression in these VICs. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to confirm the relation between miR-34c and STC1. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining was performed to further confirm the degree of calcification in these samples. MiR-34c was lowly expressed and STC1 was highly expressed in the CAVD tissues. Furthermore, STC1 was the target of miR-34c and was negatively regulated by miR-34c. Overexpression of miR-34c in VICs was concomitant with suppression of both STC1 expression and phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, significant decrease of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and osteocalcin, as well as the decrease of calcification degree were also observed in VICs with miR-34c overexpressed. Taken together, miR-34c could inhibit osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VICs by suppressing the STC1/JNK signaling pathway in CAVD, making miR-34c a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CAVD.
32938214	Resident valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activate to myofibroblasts during aortic valve stenosis progression, which further promotes fibrosis or even differentiate into osteoblast-like cells that can lead to calcification of valve tissue. Inflammation is a hallmark of aortic valve stenosis, so we aimed to determine proinflammatory cytokines secreted from M1 macrophages that give rise to a transient VIC phenotype that leads to calcification of valve tissue. Approach and Results: We designed hydrogel biomaterials as valve extracellular matrix mimics enabling the culture of VICs in either their quiescent fibroblast or activated myofibroblast phenotype in response to the local matrix stiffness. When VIC fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were treated with conditioned media from THP-1-derived M1 macrophages, we observed robust reduction of \xce\xb1SMA (alpha smooth muscle actin) expression, reduced stress fiber formation, and increased proliferation, suggesting a potent antifibrotic effect. We further identified TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-\xce\xb1 and IL (interleukin)-1\xce\xb2 as 2 cytokines in M1 media that cause the observed antifibrotic effect. After 7 days of culture in M1 conditioned media, VICs began differentiating into osteoblast-like cells, as measured by increased expression of RUNX2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) and osteopontin. We also identified and validated IL-6 as a critical mediator of the observed pro-osteogenic effect.
32774703	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) currently lacks a highly effective  pathophysiological effects. Calcification and inflammatory response assays determined that inorganic phosphate-osteogenic induction medium (IP-OIM) was more efficient than classic osteogenic induction medium (OIM) containing organic glycerophosphate. Levels of BMP-2, RhoA, and ROCK-1 were significantly increased in IP-OIM cells. Knockdown efficiency of BMP-2- and RhoA-siRNA in VICs was evaluated, and expression of RhoA and its downstream target ROCK-1 was decreased after BMP-2-siRNA transfection. Moreover, ROCK-1 was significantly downregulated after RhoA knockdown, whereas expression of BMP-2 was unchanged. Interference of BMP-2 had a stronger anti-calcification effect than RhoA, further identifying BMP-2 as an upstream regulator of RhoA/ROCK-1. Stimulation of VICs by IP-OIM led to increased Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation, which peaked at 60 min, while pre-treatment of VICs with the Smad1/5/9 inhibitor Compound C attenuated VICs calcification. These results suggest that IP-OIM induced VICs osteogenic differentiation via Smad1/5/9 signaling. Knockdown of BMP-2 or RhoA also decreased Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation also decreased. We conclude that the RhoA/ROCK-1 axis participates in VICs osteogenic differentiation as a "bypass mediator" of the BMP-2/Smad1/5/9 signaling pathway.
32733235	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) occurs  a pathophysiological process that includes inflammation-induced osteoblastic differentiation of aortic valvular interstitial cells (AVICs). Here, we investigated the role of the anti-inflammatory compound caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) in inhibiting CAVD. Human AVICs were isolated and cultured in osteogenic induction medium (OM) with or without 10 \xce\xbcM CAPE. Cell viability was assessed using CCK8 assays and calcified transformation of AVICs was evaluated by Alizarin Red staining and osteogenic gene/protein expression. RNA-sequencing was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enrichment in associated pathways, as potential molecular targets through which CAPE inhibits osteogenic induction. The regulatory effects of CAPE on activation of the AKT/NF-\xce\xbaB and NLRP3 inflammasome were evaluated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining. CAPE slowed the growth of AVICs cultured in OM but did not show significant cytotoxicity. In addition, CAPE markedly suppressed calcified nodule formation and decreased gene/protein expression of RUNX2 and ALP in AVICs. Gene expression profiles of OM-induced AVICs cultured with or without CAPE revealed 518 common DEGs, which were highly enriched in the NOD-like receptor, PI3K-AKT, and NF-\xce\xbaB signaling pathways. Furthermore, CAPE inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, and NF-\xce\xbaB, and suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in AVICs cultured in OM. Thus, CAPE is implicated as a potent natural product for the prevention of CAVD by inhibiting activation of the AKT/NF-\xce\xbaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome.

32587322	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common form of valve disease where the only available treatment strategy is surgical valve replacement. Technologies for the early detection of CAVD would benefit the development of prevention, mitigation and alternate therapeutic strategies. Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy is a label-free, non-destructive imaging technique that has been shown to correlate with multiple markers for cellular differentiation and phenotypic changes in cancer and wound healing. Here we show how specific TPEF markers, namely, the optical redox ratio and mitochondrial fractal dimension, correlate with structural, functional and phenotypic changes occurring in the aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) during osteogenic differentiation. The optical redox ratio, and fractal dimension of mitochondria were assessed and correlated with gene expression and nuclear morphology of VICs. The optical redox ratio decreased for VICs during early osteogenic differentiation and correlated with biological markers for CAVD progression. Fractal dimension correlated with structural and osteogenic markers as well as measures of nuclear morphology. Our study suggests that TPEF imaging markers, specifically the optical redox ratio and mitochondrial fractal dimension, can be potentially used as a tool for assessing early CAVD progression in vitro.
32369647	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is highly prevalent with marked morbidity and mortality rates and a lack of pharmaceutical treatment options because its mechanisms are unknown. Melatonin is reported to exert atheroprotective effects. However, whether melatonin protects against aortic valve calcification, a disease whose pathogenesis shares many similarities to that of atherosclerosis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we found that the intragastric administration of melatonin for 24 weeks markedly ameliorated aortic valve calcification in high cholesterol diet (HCD)-treated ApoE mice, as evidenced by reduced thickness and calcium deposition in the aortic valve leaflets, improved echocardiographic parameters (decreased transvalvular peak jet velocity and increased aortic valve area), and decreased osteogenic differentiation marker (Runx2, osteocalcin, and osterix) expression in the aortic valves. Consistent with these in vivo data, we also confirmed the suppression of in vitro calcification by melatonin in hVICs. Mechanistically, melatonin reduced the level of CircRIC3, a procalcification circular RNA, which functions by acting as a miR-204-5p sponge to positively regulate the expression of the procalcification gene dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). Furthermore, CircRIC3 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effects of melatonin on hVIC osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin ameliorates aortic valve calcification via the regulation of CircRIC3/miR-204-5p/DPP4 signaling in hVICs; therefore, melatonin medication might be considered a novel pharmaceutical strategy for CAVD treatment.
32247641	Inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) which is a major contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lacks non-surgical treatment. The progranulin (PGRN) is an important immunomodulatory factor in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and pneumonia. However, its role in calcification of aortic valve remains unknown. We firstly found that PGRN was increased in calcified human aortic valve (AV) tissues. Interestingly, in addition to full-length PGRN (68KD), a much stronger band of approximately 45 KD was also significantly increased. The band of 45 KD (45-GRN), was present in wild type (WT) mouse MEFs and AV but absent in grnMEFs, indicating that it was a specific degradation product derived from PGRN. 45-GRN was upregulated whereas PGRN was reduced in human valve interstitial cells (hVICs) under calcifying conditions which is induced by osteogenic medium (OM). In primary porcine VICs (pVICs), PGRN downregulated TNF-\xce\xb1 and \xce\xb1-SMA which was accompanied by downregulation of RUNX2, OPN, OCN, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, effects pointing to reduced inflammation, myofibroblastic and osteoblastic transition under calcifying conditions. We overexpressed a mimic of 45-GRN which contains p-G-F-B-A-C in pVICs. However, 45-GRN overexpression promoted OM-induced calcification through activating the Smad1/5/8, NF-\xce\xbaB and AKT signaling pathways. Inhibition of the three signaling pathways suppressed 45-GRN\'s effect on VICs phenotype transition. 45-GRN promoted TNF-\xce\xb1 and expressed converse pathogenic signatures with PGRN during TNF-\xce\xb1 stimulation. Collectively, this study provides new insight into the pathogenesis of CAVD, indicating that PGRN is a stratagem in mitigating valve fibrosis/osteoblastic differentiation, and also presenting 45-GRN as a potential target for the treatment of CAVD.

32189385	The osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hVICs) is the key cellular mechanism of calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). This study aimed to explore how curcumin (CCM) inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study, CCM inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs under osteogenic medium (OM) conditions by reversing the OM-induced increase in calcified nodule formation and osteogenesis-specific markers (ALP and Runx2). RNA sequencing identified 475 common differentially expressed genes with Venn diagrams of the different groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment revealed that the CCM inhibition of hVIC osteogenic differentiation was enriched in the NF-\xce\xbaB, PI3K-AKT, TNF, Jak-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, CCM suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK, I\xce\xbaB\xce\xb1, AKT, and interfered with the translocation of P65 into the cell nucleus in hVICs under OM culture conditions. In conclusion, CCM inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs via interfering with the activation of NF-\xce\xbaB/AKT/ERK signaling pathways. Our findings provide novel insights into a critical role for CCM in CAVD progression and shed new light on CCM-directed therapeutics for CAVD.
32169720	Reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis. Herein, we investigated the effects of l-Arginine, the main precursor of NO, on the osteogenic differentiation of aortic interstitial valve cells (VICs).
32168892	Aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a consequence of increased fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets, causes progressive narrowing of the aortic valve. Proteoglycans, structural components of the aortic valve, accumulate in regions with fibrosis and moderate calcification. Particularly, proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) has been identified in fibrotic parts of aortic valves. However, the role of PRG4 in the context of AVS and aortic valve calcification has not yet been determined. Here, transcriptomics, histology, and immunohistochemistry were performed in human aortic valves from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. Human valve interstitial cells (VICs) were used for calcification experiments and RNA expression analysis. PRG4 was significantly upregulated in thickened and calcified regions of aortic valves compared with healthy regions. In addition, mRNA levels of PRG4 positively associated with mRNA for proteins involved in cardiovascular calcification. Treatment of VICs with recombinant human PRG4 enhanced phosphate-induced calcification and increased the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and the runt-related transcription factor 2. In summary, PRG4 was upregulated in the development of AVS and promoted VIC osteogenic differentiation and calcification. These results suggest that an altered valve leaflet proteoglycan composition may play a role in the progression of AVS.
32066043	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is caused by valve interstitial cells (VICs) initiating the thickening and calcification of valve leaflets. The present study aimed to investigate whether andrographolide (AGP) could attenuate the calcification of human valve interstitial cells (hVICs). hVICs stimulated by osteoblastic medium (OM) were treated with or without AGP. RNA sequencing was utilized to investigate changes in gene expression. Cell growth and calcification of hVICs were assessed using a CCK8 assay and Alizarin Red S staining, respectively. The expression of the two calcification-related markers, RUNX2 and ALP, were quantified by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining. The results indicate that hVICs treated with OM plus AGP exhibited decreased Alizarin Red S staining compared with cells treated with OM only in addition to down-regulation of ALP and RUNX2. Mappings of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different groups using Venn diagrams during analysis of gene expression profiles, 653 common DEGs were identified that displayed different biological functions and signaling pathways after treatment with AGP. RELA, a core factor of the NF-\xce\xbaB pathway was inhibited by AGP in addition to phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. Thus, AGP attenuated calcification of hVICs. These results demonstrate that AGP, a promising natural product, can attenuate the process of CAVD.
32043019	This study sought to investigate whether reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (Nox2) contributes to calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) or whether celastrol, a natural Nox2 inhibitor, may provide potential therapeutic target for CAVD. CAVD is an active and cellular-driven fibrocalcific process characterized by differentiation of aortic valvular interstitial cells (AVICs) toward an osteogenic-like phenotype. ROS levels increase in calcified aortic valves, while the sources of ROS and their roles in the pathogenesis of CAVD are elusive. The roles of Nox2 and the effects of celastrol were studied using cultured porcine AVICs in vitro and a rabbit CAVD model in vivo. Nox2 proteins were significantly upregulated in human aortic valves with CAVD. In vitro, Nox2 was markedly induced upon stimulation of AVICs with osteogenic medium, along with the increases in ROS production and calcium nodule formation. Celastrol significantly decreased calcium deposition of AVICs by 35%, with a reduction of ROS generation. Knockdown of endogenous Nox2 substantially suppressed AVIC calcification by 39%, the inhibitory effect being similar to celastrol treatment. Mechanistically, either celastrol treatment or knockdown of Nox2 significantly inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/\xce\xb2-catenin signaling, leading to attenuation of fibrogenic and osteogenic responses of AVICs. In a rabbit CAVD model, administration of celastrol significantly reduced aortic valve ROS production, fibrosis, calcification, and severity of aortic stenosis, with less left ventricular dilatation and better preserved contractile function. Upregulation of Nox2 is critically involved in CAVD. Celastrol is effective to alleviate CAVD, likely through the inhibition of Nox2-mediated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/\xce\xb2-catenin pathway in AVICs.
31945413	Degenerative calcific aortic valve disease (DCAVD) is a common valve disease characterized by massive calcium deposits in the aortic valve. Osteoblast differentiation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) is responsible for the formation of calcific nodules. This study aims to explore the function and underlying mechanism of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AFAP1-AS1 (actin filament-associated protein 1 antisense RNA 1) in the pathogenesis of DCAVD.
31893948	Although often studied independently, little is known about how aortic valve endothelial cells and valve interstitial cells interact collaborate to maintain tissue homeostasis or drive valve calcific pathogenesis. Inflammatory signaling is a recognized initiator of valve calcification, but the cell-type-specific downstream mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we test how inflammatory signaling via NF\xce\xbaB (nuclear factor \xce\xba-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells) activity coordinates unique and shared mechanisms of valve endothelial cells and valve interstitial cells differentiation during calcific progression. Approach and Results: Activated NF\xce\xbaB was present throughout the calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) process in both endothelial and interstitial cell populations in an established mouse model of hypercholesterolemia-induced CAVD and in human CAVD. NF\xce\xbaB activity induces endothelial to mesenchymal transformation in 3-dimensional cultured aortic valve endothelial cells and subsequent osteogenic calcification of transformed cells. Similarly, 3-dimensional cultured valve interstitial cells calcified via NF\xce\xbaB-mediated osteogenic differentiation. NF\xce\xbaB-mediated endothelial to mesenchymal transformation was directly demonstrated in vivo during CAVD via genetic lineage tracking. Genetic deletion of NF\xce\xbaB in either whole valves or valve endothelium only was sufficient to prevent valve-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of CAVD in vivo despite the persistence of a CAVD inducing environment.
31852220	RA inhibited osteoblast mineralization.
31301902	Aortic valve calcification is common in aging populations without effective pharmacologic interventions. Our previous in vitro data revealed a critical role for long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 as a positive regulator of osteogenic differentiation in aortic valve calcification pathogenesis. The current study sought to determine the mechanism by which metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 is regulated in aortic valve calcification.
31140727	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a complex heart valve disease involving a wide range of pathological changes. Emerging evidence indicates that osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hAVICs) plays a key role in valve calcification. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of miR-638 in hAVICs osteogenesis. Both miRNA microarray assay and qRT-PCR results demonstrating miR-638 was obviously up-regulated in calcific aortic valves compared with non-calcific valves. We also proved that miR-638 was significantly up-regulated during hAVICs osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR-638 suppressed osteogenic differentiation of hAVICs in vitro, whereas down-regulation of miR-638 enhance the process. Target prediction analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Sp7 transcription factor (Sp7) was a direct target of miR-638. Furthermore, knockdown of Sp7 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hAVICs, which is similar to the results observed in up-regulation miR-638. Our data indicated that miR-638 plays an inhibitory role in hAVICs osteogenic differentiation, which may act by targeting Sp7. MiR-638 may be a potential therapeutic target for CAVD.
31861929	Aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) play a major role in valvular calcification associated with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Although AVICs from diseased valves display a pro-osteogenic phenotype, the underlying mechanism causing this remains unclear. MicroRNA-204 (miR-204) is a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. We sought to analyze miR-204 expression in diseased human aortic valves and determine the role of this miR in AVIC osteogenic activity associated with CAVD pathobiology. In situ hybridization and PCR analysis revealed miR-204 deficiency in diseased valves and in AVICs from diseased valves. MiR-204 mimic suppressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and calcium deposition in AVICs from diseased valves. MiR-204 antagomir enhanced ALP expression in AVICs from normal valves through induction of Runx2 and Osx, and expression of miR-204 antagomir in mouse aortic valves promoted calcium deposition through up-regulation of Runx2 and Osx. Further, miR-204 mimic suppressed the osteogenic responses to TGF-\xce\xb21 in AVICs of normal valves. In conclusion, miR-204 deficiency contributes to the mechanism underlying elevated osteogenic activity in diseased aortic valves, and miR-204 is capable of reversing the pro-osteogenic phenotype of AVICs of diseased valves and suppressing AVIC osteogenic response to stimulation. Exogenous miR-204 may have therapeutic potential for inhibiting valvular calcification associated with CAVD progression.
31582988	Aortic valve calcification is a common clinical disease, caused by valve interstitial cells (VICs), which initiate the thickening and then calcification of valve leaflets. Classical valve-derived cells can be seen in different cell populations according to their different morphologies, but it is not clear whether different types of mesenchymal cells exist. In this study, culture conditions for mesenchymal stromal cells were used to selectively isolate valve-derived stromal cells (VDSCs). After subculturing, the morphology, proliferation, multidifferentiation, immunophenotype, and gene expression profiling in isolated VDSCs were compared with those in conventional cultured VICs. VDSCs isolated from human aortic valves were uniform spindle-shaped fibroblasts, had mutilineage differentiation abilities, and proliferated faster than VICs. Classic mesenchymal markers including cluster of differentiation 90 (CD90), CD44, and CD29 were positively expressed. In addition, the stem cell markers CD163, CD133, and CD106 were all expressed in VDSCs. RNA-sequencing identified 1595 differentially expressed genes between VDSCs and VICs of which 301 were upregulated and 1294 were downregulated. Valvular extracellular matrix genes of VDSCs such as collagen type 1, alpha 1 (COL1A1), COL1A2, and fibronectin 1 were abundantly expressed. In addition, runt-related transcription factor 2 and Ki-67 proteins were also markedly upregulated in VDSCs, whereas there was less expression of the focal adhesion genes integrin alpha and laminin alpha in VDSCs compared to VICs. In conclusion, novel rapidly proliferating VDSCs with fibroblast morphology, which were found to express mesenchymal and osteogenic markers, may contribute to aortic valve calcification.
31506459	Valve interstitial cells (VICs) are crucial in the development of calcific aortic valve disease. The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the phenotype, differentiation potential and stem cell-like properties of cells from calcified and healthy aortic valves. VICs were isolated from human healthy and calcified aortic valves. Calcification was induced with osteogenic medium. Unlike VICs from healthy valves, VICs from calcified valves cultured without osteogenic medium stained positively for calcium deposits with Alizarin Red confirming their calcific phenotype. Stimulation of VICs from calcified valves with osteogenic medium increased calcification (p = 0.02), but not significantly different from healthy VICs. When stimulated with myofibroblastic medium, VICs from calcified valves had lower expression of myofibroblastic markers, measured by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR, compared to healthy VICs. Contraction of collagen gel (a measure of myofibroblastic activity) was attenuated in cells from calcified valves (p = 0.04). Moreover, VICs from calcified valves, unlike cells from healthy valves had lower potential to differentiate into adipogenic pathway and lower expression of stem cell-associated markers CD106 (p = 0.04) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (p = 0.04). In conclusion, VICs from calcified aortic have reduced multipotency compared to cells from healthy valves, which should be considered when investigating possible medical treatments of aortic valve calcification.
31437530	The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether SNF472, the hexasodium salt of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (IP6 or phytate): 1. Inhibits induced calcification in cultured aortic valve interstitial cells (VIC) as an in vitro model of aortic valve stenosis and 2. Whether inhibition is different in VIC obtained from healthy and calcified aortic valves. VIC from healthy (n = 5) and calcified (n = 7) human aortic valves were seeded in basic growth medium, osteogenic differentiation medium alone, or in osteogenic medium with SNF472 (3, 10, and 30 \xce\xbcM) and cultivated for 3 weeks. Calcification was quantified spectrophotometrically after Alizarin Red staining. In VIC from calcified valves, a complete inhibition of calcification was observed with SNF472 concentrations of 10 and 30 \xce\xbcM (p < .01), significantly stronger than in VIC from healthy valves. When SNF472 was added to VIC after 1 week in osteogenic medium, 30 and 100 \xce\xbcM SNF472 inhibited the progression of ongoing calcification by 81 and 100% (p < .01), respectively. The same concentrations of SNF472 given after 2 weeks reduced calcification by 35 and 40% respectively (not significant). SNF472 inhibited both the formation and the progression of calcification with the strongest effect in VIC from calcified valves.
31136747	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), previously thought to represent a passive degeneration of the valvular extracellular matrix (VECM), is now regarded as an intricate multistage disorder with sequential yet intertangled and interacting underlying processes. Endothelial dysfunction and injury, initiated by disturbed blood flow and metabolic disorders, lead to the deposition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the VECM further provoking macrophage infiltration, oxidative stress, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such changes in the valvular homeostasis induce differentiation of normally quiescent valvular interstitial cells (VICs) into synthetically active myofibroblasts producing excessive quantities of the VECM and proteins responsible for its remodeling. As a result of constantly ongoing degradation and re-deposition, VECM becomes disorganised and rigid, additionally potentiating myofibroblastic differentiation of VICs and worsening adaptation of the valve to the blood flow. Moreover, disrupted and excessively vascularised VECM is susceptible to the dystrophic calcification caused by calcium and phosphate precipitating on damaged collagen fibers and concurrently accompanied by osteogenic differentiation of VICs. Being combined, passive calcification and biomineralisation synergistically induce ossification of the aortic valve ultimately resulting in its mechanical incompetence requiring surgical replacement. Unfortunately, multiple attempts have failed to find an efficient conservative treatment of CAVD; however, therapeutic regimens and clinical settings have also been far from the optimal. In this review, we focused on interactions and transitions between aforementioned mechanisms demarcating ascending stages of CAVD, suggesting a predisposing condition (bicuspid aortic valve) and drug combination (lipid-lowering drugs combined with angiotensin II antagonists and cytokine inhibitors) for the further testing in both preclinical and clinical trials.
31047003	Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a major carrier of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), is associated with an increased incidence of aortic stenosis (AS). However, it remains unclear whether elevated Lp(a) and OxPL drive disease progression and are therefore targets for therapeutic intervention.
31041314	Aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs) isolated from patients undergoing valve replacement are commonly used as  research. Here we report that in calcification media containing organic phosphate, termed osteogenic media (OM), primary human VICs exhibited a passage-dependent decrease in calcification potential, which was not observed in calcification media containing inorganic phosphate, termed pro-calcifying media (PM). We used Alizarin red staining to compare the calcification potential of VICs cultured in OM and PM between the first and fourth passages after cell isolation from human CAVD tissues. Human VICs showed consistent Alizarin red stain when cultured with PM in a passage-independent manner. VICs cultured in OM did not exhibit consistent calcification potential between donors in early passages and consistently lacked positive Alizarin red stain in late passages. We performed whole cell, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation proteomics to identify factors regulating VIC passage-dependent calcification in OM. Proteomics cluster analysis identified tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) as a regulator of passage-dependent calcification in OM. We verified an association of TNAP activity with calcification potential in VICs cultured in OM, but not in PM in which VICs calcified independent of TNAP activity. This study demonstrates that media culture conditions and cell passage impact the calcification potential of primary human VICs and should be taken into consideration in cell culture models of CAVD. Our results help standardize CAVD modeling as part of a greater effort to identify disease driving mechanisms and therapeutics for this unmet medical need.
31034990	In early stages of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), immune cells infiltrate into the valve leaflets and release cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\xce\xb3. IFN-\xce\xb3 has context-dependent direct effects, and also regulates other immune pathways. The purpose of this study was addressing the effects of IFN-\xce\xb3 on human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs), focusing on the pathogenic processes underlying CAVD. Strikingly, under normoxic conditions, IFN-\xce\xb3 induced hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\xce\xb1 expression, an effect strongly potentiated by the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunodetection studies confirmed the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\xce\xb1. Gene silencing showed that HIF-1\xce\xb1 expression is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 expression. Consistent with HIF-1\xce\xb1 induction, the secretion of the endothelial growth factor was detected by ELISA, and downregulation of the antiangiogenic factor chondromodulin-1 gene was observed by qPCR. Results also disclosed IFN-\xce\xb3 as a proinflammatory cytokine that cooperates with LPS to induce the expression of adhesion molecules, prostaglandin E and interleukins. Moreover, IFN-\xce\xb3 induced an osteogenic phenotype and promoted in vitro calcification that were markedly potentiated by LPS. Pharmacological experiments disclosed the involvement of Janus Kinases (JAK)/STATs as well as ERK/HIF-1\xce\xb1 routes on the induction of calcification. Notably, IFN-\xce\xb3 receptor 1 expression, as well as ERK/HIF-1\xce\xb1 activation, and the subsequent responses were more robust in male AVICs. This is the first report uncovering an immune and non-hypoxic activation of HIF-1\xce\xb1 via STAT1 in AVIC. The aforementioned results and the sex-differential responses may be potentially relevant to better understand CAVD pathogenesis.
30901896	Lamin A is involved in many cellular functions due to its ability to bind chromatin and transcription factors and affect their properties. Mutations of  mutation is strongly dependent not only on a specific mutation itself, but also might be influenced by the intrinsic molecular context of a cell lineage.
33405617	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular disease. CAVD exhibits progressive disruption of the normally highly organized and aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) structure within the valve leaflets simultaneously with myofibroblastic and/or osteogenic differentiation of indigenous endogenous valve interstitial cells (VIC). It is unclear how the alignment of VIC within their 3D microenvironment drives VIC phenotype or how alignment affects cellular responses to biochemical cues in physiological or pathological conditions. In this study, we implement a photolithographic technique to control the alignment and elongation of both normal and diseased human aortic VIC (HAVIC) within microengineered 3D hydrogels consisting of methacrylated hyaluronic acid and methacrylated gelatin. Stripe micropatterning created distinct alignment of HAVIC within a 3D culture system, which promoted spreading and enhanced their activation and osteogenic differentiation in pro-osteogenic conditions. HAVIC from a patient with CAVD exhibited greater susceptibility to myofibroblastic and osteogenic differentiation in culture. The roles of conjugated basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) and RhoA/ROCK pathway in regulating HAVIC phenotypes were also investigated in the presence of aligned microtopography. The addition of bFGF was preventative to osteogenic differentiation for healthy HAVIC; however, it promoted osteogenic differentiation in diseased HAVIC. Inhibition of the ROCK pathway only decreased osteogenic differentiation for diseased HAVIC in the aligned formation. Collectively, these results improve our knowledge of the effects that VIC alignment has on VIC phenotypes and valve disease progression. The cell culture platform also enables a better understanding of the interplay between topography, biochemical cues, and VIC differentiation and provides information useful for directing differentiation as well as valve tissue regeneration.
30846207	OIP5-AS1, a highly abundant imprinted long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been implicated in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, the function and underlying mechanism of OIP5-AS1 in CAVD progression remains unknown. In this study, osteoblastic differentiation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) isolated from human calcific aortic valves was induced by osteogenic medium. The protein levels of osteogenic markers were determined by immunofluorescence and western blotting. OIP5-AS1, miR-137 and TWIST-related protein 1 (TWIST1) expressions were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). ALP activity was evaluated by spectrophotometry. Mineralized bone matrix formation was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining. The interaction between OIP5-AS1 and miR-137 was studied using luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Luciferase reporter assay was also used to identify the possible interaction between miR-137 and TWIST11. The results showed that downregulated expression of OIP5-AS1 was observed in human aortic VICs after osteogenic induction. In vitro experiments revealed that OIP5-AS1 acted as a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, we further showed that OIP5-AS1 could relieve osteogenic differentiation of VICs via upregulating miR-137 target gene TWIST1. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the cross-talk between OIP5-AS1, miR-137, and TWIST11, shedding light on the therapy for CAVD.
30796046	Heart valve cells mediate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling during postnatal valve leaflet stratification, but phenotypic and transcriptional diversity of valve cells in development is largely unknown. Single cell analysis of mouse heart valve cells was used to evaluate cell heterogeneity during postnatal ECM remodeling and leaflet morphogenesis. The transcriptomic analysis of single cells from postnatal day (P)7 and P30 murine aortic (AoV) and mitral (MV) heart valves uncovered distinct subsets of melanocytes, immune and endothelial cells present at P7 and P30. By contrast, interstitial cell populations are different from P7 to P30. P7 valve leaflets exhibit two distinct collagen- and glycosaminoglycan-expressing interstitial cell clusters, and prevalent ECM gene expression. At P30, four interstitial cell clusters are apparent with leaflet specificity and differential expression of complement factors, ECM proteins and osteogenic genes. This initial transcriptomic analysis of postnatal heart valves at single cell resolution demonstrates that subpopulations of endothelial and immune cells are relatively constant throughout postnatal development, but interstitial cell subpopulations undergo changes in gene expression and cellular functions in primordial and mature valves.
30746757	Both aortic and mitral valves calcify in pathological conditions; however, the prevalence of aortic valve calcification is high whereas mitral valve leaflet calcification is somewhat rare. Patterns of valvular calcification may differ due to valvular architecture, but little is known to that effect. In this study, we investigated the intrinsic osteogenic differentiation potential of aortic versus mitral valve interstitial cells provided minimal differentiation conditions. For the assessment of calcification at the cellular level, we used classic inducers of osteogenesis in stem cells: \xce\xb2-glycerophosphate (\xce\xb2-Gly), dexamethasone (Dex), and ascorbate (Asc). In addition to proteomic analyses, osteogenic markers and calcium precipitates were evaluated across treatments of aortic and mitral valve cells. The combination of \xce\xb2-Gly, Asc, and Dex induced aortic valve interstitial cells to synthesize extracellular matrix, overexpress osteoblastic markers, and deposit calcium. However, no strong evidence showed the calcification of mitral valve interstitial cells. Mitral cells mainly responded to Asc and Dex by cell activation. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the physiological properties of aortic and mitral valves and tendencies for calcific changes within each valve type, contributing to the development of future therapeutics for heart valve diseases.
30579537	Aortic valve (AoV) calcification occurs via a pathophysiologic process that includes osteoblastic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Here, we investigated the role of HDAC6 in AoV calcification.
30464116	The aim of this study was to explore the function of miR-138 in the pathogenesis of degenerative calcific aortic valve disease (DCAVD).Aortic valve calcification tissue and normal tissue from DCAVD patients were collected to detect the expression of miR-138 by qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to identify the phenotype of valve interstitial cells. QRT-PCR was performed to analyze the expression of miR-138, Runx2, MSX2, and ALP at day 7 after osteogenic differentiation. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay was performed at day 14 after osteogenic differentiation. Alizarin red staining was used to analyze the calcium nodule formation. TargetScan was used to predict potential targets of miR-138. QRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to analyze the expression of FOXC1 in valve interstitial cells (VICs). The aortic valve calcification was evaluated by quantitative analysis of the velocity in the aortic annulus and transvalvular pressure gradients.In this study, we demonstrated the role of miR-138 in VIC osteogenesis. QRT-PCR results revealed miR-138 was significantly down-regulated in calcified aortic valves compared with non-calcified valves. MiR-138 overexpression inhibited VIC osteogenic differentiation in vitro, while down-regulation of miR-138 enhanced the process. Target prediction analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed FOXC1 was a direct target of miR-138. Further research found FOXC1 overexpression promoted VIC osteogenic differentiation. In addition, animal experiments validated indirectly miR-138 could suppress aortic valve calcification.Our findings suggest miR-138 could function as a new inhibitor of VIC osteogenic differentiation, which may act by targeting FOXC1.
30246479	We have previously demonstrated that Lrp5/6/\xce\xb2-catenin plays an important role in valve calcification with a specific osteogenic phenotype defined by increased bone mineral content and overall valve thickening. Recent studies indicate that TIEG1 may be involved in mediating the Wnt signaling pathway in bone, which is known to play critical roles in osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization. Therefore, we sought to test the role of TIEG1 in mediating Wnt signaling, in an established model of hypercholesterolemic valve disease. Our previous model treated null mice with cholesterol diets: Lrp5  mice versus wild-type control (n = 180). Group I (n = 60) normal diet, Group II (n = 60) 0.25% chol diet (w/w), and Group III (n = 60) 0.25% (w/w) chol diet + atorv was tested for gene expression for TIEG1, Lrp6, and Runx2. Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed that there is upregulation of the gene expression for TIEG1 and Runx2 in the hypercholesterolemic double knockout and single knockout valves as compared with controls with a mild increase in Lrp6. To confirm the mechanism, coexpression of \xce\xb2-catenin, TIEG1, and LEF1 in valve cells in vitro, led to the coactivation of the TOPFLASH reporter, which was further confirmed by the observation that TIEG1 and \xce\xb2-catenin colocalize with one another in the nucleus of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) following stimulation with transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2 treatment, an established activator of TIEG1. Taken together, these data implicate an important role for TIEG1 in mediating valve osteogenesis.
30524301	Inflammation and mechanical stress trigger expression of osteogenic genes in VICs in a side-specific manner, while inhibiting the myofibroblastic pathway. Stretch and lipopolysaccharide synergistically increase calcification.
30371255	Background Aortic valve sclerosis ( AVS c), the early asymptomatic presentation of calcific aortic valve (AV) disease, affects 25% to 30% of patients aged >65 years. In vitro and ex vivo experiments with antioxidant strategies and antagonists of osteogenic differentiation revealed that AVS c is reversible. In this study, we characterized the underlying changes in the extracellular matrix architecture and valve interstitial cell activation in AVSc and tested in vitro and in vivo the activity of a clinically approved SOD (superoxide dismutase) mimic and redox-active drug MnTnBu OE -2-PyP controls AV thickening in a murine model of AVS c. Because this compound has been approved recently for clinical use, this work could shift the focus for the treatment of calcific AV disease, moving from AV stenosis to an earlier presentation ( AVS c) that could be more responsive to medical therapies.
30053524	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and lacks non-surgical treatment. The pathogenesis of CAVD involves perturbation of valvular cells by mechanical stimuli, including shear stress, pressure load and leaflet stretch, of which the molecular mechanism requires further elucidation. We recently demonstrated that knockout (KO) of Cnn2 gene that encodes calponin isoform 2, a mechanoregulated cytoskeleton protein, attenuates atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Here we report that Cnn2 KO also decreased calcification of the aortic valve in ApoE KO mice, an established model of CAVD. Although myeloid cell-specific Cnn2 KO highly effectively attenuated vascular atherosclerosis that shares many pathogenic processes with CAVD, it did not reduce aortic valve calcification in ApoE KO mice. Indicating a function in the pathogenesis of CAVD, calponin 2 participates in myofibroblast differentiation that is a leading step in the development of CAVD. The aortic valves of ApoE KO mice exhibited increased expression of calponin 2 and smooth muscle actin (SMA), a hallmark of myofibroblasts. The expression of calponin 2 increased during myofibroblast-like differentiation of primary sheep aortic valve interstitial cells and during the osteogenic differentiation of mouse myofibroblasts. Cnn2 KO attenuated TGF\xce\xb21-induced differentiation of myofibroblasts in culture as shown by the lower expression of SMA and less calcification than that of wild type (WT) cells. These findings present calponin 2 as a novel molecular target for the treatment and prevention of CAVD.
30026273	Objective- Calcific aortic valve disease is the most prevalent valvulopathy in Western countries. An unanticipated pathogenetic clue involving IFN (interferon) was disclosed by the finding of constitutive type I IFN activity associated with aortic valve calcification in children with the atypical Singleton-Merten syndrome. On this basis, the role of type I IFN on inflammation and calcification in human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVIC) was examined. Approach and Results- IFN-\xce\xb1 was weakly proinflammatory but potentiated lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of NF (nuclear factor)-\xce\xbaB and the ensuing induction of proinflammatory molecules in human AVIC. Stimulation with IFN-\xce\xb1 and in combination with lipopolysaccharide promoted osteoblast-like differentiation characterized by increased osteoblastic gene expression, BMP (bone morphogenetic protein)-2 secretion, and ectopic phosphatase activity. Sex differences were observed. Likewise, IFN-\xce\xb1 treatment of human AVICs in osteogenic medium resulted in increased formation of calcific nodules. Strikingly, IFN-\xce\xb1-mediated calcification was significantly higher in AVICs from males, and was blocked by tofacitinib, a JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor, and by a BMP antagonist. A female-specific protective mechanism involving the activation of PI3K-Akt (protein kinase B) pathways and cell survival was disclosed. Females exhibited higher levels of BCL2 in valve cells and tissues and lower annexin V staining on cell stimulation. Conclusions- IFN-\xce\xb1 acts as a proinflammatory and pro-osteogenic cytokine in AVICs, its effects being potentiated by lipopolysaccharide. Results also uncovered sex differences with lower responses in female AVICs and sex-specific mechanisms involving apoptosis. Data point to JAK/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) system as a potential therapeutic target for calcific aortic valve disease.
29679571	Osteoblastic differentiation of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) is the central process in the development of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Metformin is a widely used first-line antidiabetic drug, and recently, pleiotropic benefits of metformin beyond hypoglycemia have been reported in the cardiovascular system. Here, we examined the effect of metformin on the osteoblastic differentiation of human AVICs. Our results showed that metformin ameliorated TGF-\xce\xb21-induced production of osteogenic proteins Runx2 and osteopontin as well as calcium deposition in the cultured human AVICs. Experiments using AICAR, Compound C and AMPK\xce\xb1 siRNA showed that the beneficial effect of metformin on TGF-\xce\xb21-induced osteoblastic differentiation of human AVICs was mediated by AMPK\xce\xb1. Moreover, metformin inhibited the TGF-\xce\xb21-induced activation of \xce\xb2-catenin, and \xce\xb2-catenin siRNA blocked TGF-\xce\xb21-induced osteoblastic differentiation of AVICs. Smad2/3 and JNK were phosphorylated to promote the TGF-\xce\xb21-induced activation of \xce\xb2-catenin and osteoblastic differentiation of AVICs, and metformin also alleviated TGF-\xce\xb21-induced activation of Smad2/3 and JNK. In conclusion, our results suggest a beneficial effect of metformin based on the prevention of osteoblastic differentiation of human AVICs via inhibition of \xce\xb2-catenin, which indicates the therapeutic potential of metformin for CAVD.
29308559	Comparative in vitro study examined the osteogenic potential of interstitial cells of aortic valve obtained from the patients with aortic stenosis and from control recipients of orthotopic heart transplantation with intact aortic valve. The osteogenic inductors augmented mineralization of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVIC) in patients with aortic stenosis in comparison with the control level. Native AVIC culture of aortic stenosis patients demonstrated overexpression of osteopontin gene (OPN) and underexpression of osteoprotegerin gene (OPG) in comparison with control levels. In both groups, AVIC differentiation was associated with overexpression of RUNX2 and SPRY1 genes. In AVIC of aortic stenosis patients, expression of BMP2 gene was significantly greater than the control level. The study revealed an enhanced sensitivity of AVIC to osteogenic inductors in aortic stenosis patients, which indicates probable implication of OPN, OPG, and BMP2 genes in pathogenesis of aortic valve calcification.
29227539	Herein, we hypothesized that pro-osteogenic MicroRNAs (miRs) could play functional roles in the calcification of the aortic valve and aimed to explore the functional role of miR-29b in the osteoblastic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hAVICs) and the underlying molecular mechanism. Osteoblastic differentiation of hAVICs isolated from human calcific aortic valve leaflets obtained intraoperatively was induced with an osteogenic medium. Alizarin red S staining was used to evaluate calcium deposition. The protein levels of osteogenic markers and other proteins were evaluated using western blotting and/or immunofluorescence while qRT-PCR was applied for miR and mRNA determination. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assay were used to identify the possible interaction between miR-29b and TGF-\xce\xb23. Calcium deposition and the number of calcification nodules were pointedly and progressively increased in hAVICs during osteogenic differentiation. The levels of osteogenic and calcification markers were equally increased, thus confirming the mineralization of hAVICs. The expression of miR-29b was significantly increased during osteoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, the osteoblastic differentiation of hAVICs was significantly inhibited by the miR-29b inhibition. TGF-\xce\xb23 was markedly downregulated while Smad3, Runx2, wnt3, and \xce\xb2-catenin were significantly upregulated during osteogenic induction at both the mRNA and protein levels. These effects were systematically induced by miR-29b overexpression while the inhibition of miR-29b showed the inverse trends. Moreover, TGF-\xce\xb23 was a direct target of miR-29b. Inhibition of miR-29b hinders valvular calcification through the upregulation of the TGF-\xce\xb23 via inhibition of wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin and RUNX2/Smad3 signaling pathways.
29016735	Emerging evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a vital role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. Although the lncRNA TUG1 is implicated in atherosclerosis, its function in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) remains unknown.
28488393	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a major cardiovascular disorder caused by osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) within aortic valves. Conventional methods like colorimetric assays and histology fail to detect small calcium depositions during in-vitro VIC cultures. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a robust analytical tool used for inorganic materials characterizations, but relatively new to biomedical applications. We employ LIBS, for the first time, for quantitative in-vitro detection of calcium depositions in VICs at various osteogenic differentiation stages. VICs isolated from porcine aortic valves were cultured in osteogenic media over various days. Colorimetric calcium assays based on arsenazo dye and Von Kossa staining measured the calcium depositions within VICs. Simultaneously, LIBS signatures for Ca I (422.67 nm) atomic emission lines were collected for estimating calcium depositions in lyophilized VIC samples. Our results indicate excellent linear correlation between the calcium assay and our LIBS measurements. Furthermore, unlike the assay results, the LIBS results could resolve calcium signals from cell samples with as early as 2 days of osteogenic culture. Quantitatively, the LIBS measurements establish the limit of detection for calcium content in VICs to be \xe2\x88\xbc0.17\xc2\xb10.04 \xce\xbcg which indicates a 5-fold improvement over calcium assay. Picture: Quantitative LIBS enables in-vitro analysis for early stage detection of calcium deposition within aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs).
29148548	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most frequent cardiac valve pathology. Its standard treatment consists of surgical replacement either with mechanical (metal made) or biological (animal tissue made) valve prostheses, both of which have glaring deficiencies. In the search for novel materials to manufacture artificial valve tissue, we have conducted a high-throughput screening with subsequent up-scaling to identify non-degradable polymer substrates that promote valve interstitial cells (VICs) adherence/growth and, at the same time, prevent their evolution toward a pro-calcific phenotype. Here, we provide evidence that one of the two identified \'hit\' polymers, poly(methoxyethylmethacrylate-co-diethylaminoethylmethacrylate), provided robust VICs adhesion and maintained the healthy VICs phenotype without inducing pro-osteogenic differentiation. This ability was also maintained when the polymer was used to coat a non-woven poly-caprolactone (PCL) scaffold using a novel solvent coating procedure, followed by bioreactor-assisted VICs seeding. Since we observed that VICs had an increased secretion of the elastin-maturing component MFAP4 in addition to other valve-specific extracellular matrix components, we conclude that valve implants constructed with this polyacrylate will drive the biological response of human valve-specific cells.
28821833	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common heart valve disorder, yet its mechanism remains poorly understood. Valve interstitial cells (VICs) are the prevalent cells in aortic valve and their osteogenic differentiation may be responsible for calcific nodule formation in CAVD pathogenesis. Emerging evidence shows microRNA (miRNA, or miR) can function as important regulators of many pathological processes, including osteogenic differentiation. Here, we aimed to explore the function of miR-449c-5p in CAVD pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated the role of miR-449c-5p in VICs osteogenesis. MiRNA microarray assay and qRT-PCR results revealed miR-449c-5p was significantly down-regulated in calcified aortic valves compared with non-calcified valves. MiR-449c-5p overexpression inhibited VICs osteogenic differentiation in vitro, whereas down-regulation of miR-449c-5p enhanced the process. Target prediction analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed Smad4 was a direct target of miR-449c-5p. Furthermore, knockdown of Smad4 inhibited VICs osteogenic differentiation, similar to the effect observed in up-regulation miR-449c-5p. In addition, animal experiments proved indirectly miR-449c-5p could alleviate aortic valve calcification. Our data suggested miR-449c-5p could function as a new inhibitory regulator of VICs osteogenic differentiation, which may act by targeting Smad4. MiR-449c-5p may be a potential therapeutic target for CAVD.
28607103	Mitochondrial changes occur during cell differentiation and cardiovascular disease. DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial fission. We hypothesized that DRP1 plays a role in cardiovascular calcification, a process involving cell differentiation and a major clinical problem with high unmet needs.
28522163	Emerging evidences have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. The lncRNA MALAT1, a highly abundant and conserved imprinted gene, has been implicated in many cardiovascular diseases. However, the function of MALAT1 in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) remains unknown. This study sought to document the function and underlying mechanism of MALAT1 in regulating CAVD.
28438736	The transition of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) to myofibroblastic and osteoblast-like phenotypes plays a critical role in calcific aortic valve disease progression. Several microRNAs (miRs) are implicated in stem cell differentiation into osteoblast. We hypothesized that an epigenetic mechanism regulates valvular pro-osteogenic activity. This study examined miR profile in AVICs of calcified valves and identified miRs responsible for AVIC phenotypic transition.
28362018	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is common among the elderly, and aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) exhibit unique inflammatory and osteogenic responses to pro-inflammatory stimulation which play an important role in valvular fibrosis and calcification. Thus, suppression of AVIC pro-inflammatory response may have therapeutic utility for prevention of CAVD progression. Interleukin (IL)-37, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, reduces tissue inflammation.
28283241	The purpose of the present study was to comprehensively compare the phenotype profile of infiltrated macrophages in human noncalcified and calcific aortic valves, and to determine whether the shift of macrophage polarization modulates valvular calcification in vitro.
28179397	Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular calcification and promotes calcific aortic valve disease progression.
28111052	The calcific aortic valve (AV) disease is a common disease with the unclear mechanism, and optimal pharmacological treatment remains unavailable. Epigenetic modulation by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) plays a critical role in osteogenic transdifferentiation and atherosclerosis. The purposes of this study were to investigate whether HAT contributes to the pathophysiology of AV calcification and assess the therapeutic potential of HAT inhibition.
28024939	Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been shown to be involved in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, the association between RAGE and ER stress remains unknown in the pathogenesis of CAVD. The current study aims to test the hypothesis that RAGE deficiency alleviates aortic valve calcification via the inhibition of ER stress. Up-regulation of RAGE and ER stress markers in calcified human aortic valves were confirmed by immunoblotting. Aortic valve calcification was evaluated in atherosclerotic prone ApoE mice via inhibition of ER stress. HMGB1 induces AVIC osteoblastic differentiation and calcification through RAGE/ER stress/Sox9 pathway.
27761653	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a major cardiovascular disorder in the developed countries. Male is a known risk factor in this disease; unfortunately, how sex contributes to CAVD is mostly unknown. The objective of this study is to determine whether valvular interstitial cells (VICs) isolated from male versus female aortic valves demonstrate difference in osteogenic differentiation and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. VICs were isolated from male and female rat or porcine aortic valves and cultured in osteogenic media for 10, 15 and 20 days. The proliferation among male and female VICs was assessed by a cell growth assay. The matrix remodeling of the VIC samples was quantified using glycosaminoglycan (GAG), collagen type I and gelatin zymography assays. Early osteogenic marker expression was assessed using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and enzyme activity assay and Alizarin Red S staining. Our result showed that proliferation of VICs was significantly greater in female than male after 12 days of culture in regular media. Additionally, male VICs showed elevated amounts of normalized GAG, collagen I, and activated matrix metallopreoteniase-2 expression compared to female. Similarly, ALP content was greater in male VICs than female at all time points. In addition, male VICs formed calcific nodules with greater size, % area and integrated density than females. The results from this research suggest that there is a sex-related difference in the events associated with osteogenic differentiation of the aortic VICs, where male VICs are more prone to calcification.
26631842	Current options for aortic valve replacements are non-viable and thus lack the ability to grow and remodel, which can be problematic for paediatric applications. Toward the development of living valve substitutes that can grow and remodel, porcine aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) were isolated and encapsulated within proteolytically degradable and cell-adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, in an effort to study their phenotypes and functions. The results showed that encapsulated VICs maintained high viability and proliferated within the hydrogels. The VICs actively remodelled the hydrogels via secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and deposition of new extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagens I and III. The soft hydrogels with compressive moduli of ~4.3 kPa quickly reverted VICs from an activated myofibroblastic phenotype to a quiescent, unactivated phenotype, evidenced by the loss of \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin expression upon encapsulation. In an effort to promote VIC-mediated ECM production, ascorbic acid (AA) was supplemented in the medium to investigate its effects on VIC function and phenotype. AA treatment enhanced VIC spreading and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis. AA treatment also promoted VIC-mediated ECM remodelling by increasing MMP-2 activity and depositing collagens I and III. AA treatment did not significantly influence the expression of \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin (myofibroblast activation marker) and alkaline phosphatase (osteogenic differentiation marker). No calcification or nodule formation was observed within the cell-laden hydrogels, with or without AA treatment. These results suggest the potential of this system and the beneficial effect of AA in heart valve tissue engineering. Copyright \xc2\xa9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
28220141	Knowledge of how extracellular matrix (ECM) binding impacts valve interstitial cells (VICs) is critical not only to better understanding the etiology of valvular diseases but also to constructing living valve substitutes that can grow and remodel. Use of ECM-mimicking adhesive peptides with specific affinity to different receptors provides insights into adhesion-mediated cell signaling and downstream outcomes. Expression of adhesion receptors by VICs was assessed by flow cytometry and used to guide the choice of peptides studied. The peptide RGDS with affinity to multiple integrin receptors, and specific receptor-targeting peptides DGEA (integrin \xce\xb1), YIGSR (67kDa laminin/elastin receptor; 67LR), and VAPG (67LR) were incorporated into hydrogels to investigate their effects on VICs. DGEA, YIGSR, and VAPG alone were insufficient to induce stable VIC adhesion. As a result, these peptides were studied in combination with 1 mM RGDS. For VICs cultured on two-dimensional hydrogel surfaces, YIGSR and VAPG down-regulated the expression of smooth muscle \xce\xb1-actin (myofibroblast activation marker); DGEA promoted VIC adhesion and VIC-mediated ECM deposition and inhibited the activity of alkaline phosphatase (osteogenic differentiation marker). Further, YIGSR and DGEA in combination promoted ECM deposition while inhibiting both myofibroblastic and osteogenic differentiation. However, VICs behaved differently to adhesive ligands when cultured within three-dimensional hydrogels, with most VICs assuming a healthy, quiescent phenotype under all peptide conditions tested. DGEA promoted ECM deposition by VICs within hydrogels. Overall, we demonstrate that the presentation of defined peptides targeting specific adhesion receptors can be used to regulate VIC adhesion, phenotype and ECM synthesis.
27815266	Aortic stenosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease, and calcification plays an important role in the progression of the disease. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a proinflammatory molecule involved in vascular osteogenesis in atherosclerosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that Gal-3 could mediate valve calcification in AS.
27376093	The pathogenesis of calcific aortic valvular disease (CAVD) involves an active inflammatory process of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) characterized by the activation of specific osteogenic signaling pathways and apoptosis. This process can be studied by analyzing certain molecular markers and gene expression pathways of spontaneous calcification. The purpose of our study is to investigate the role of sodium phosphate (Na3PO4) as a calcification promoter, with the aim of improving in vitro animal models for testing potential calcification inhibitors.
27304080	Nanofibrous scaffolds with defined architectures and anisotropic mechanical properties are attractive for many tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Here, a novel electrospinning system is developed and implemented to fabricate continuous processable uniaxially aligned nanofiber yarns (UANY). UANY were processed into fibrous tissue scaffolds with defined anisotropic material properties using various textile-forming technologies, i.e., braiding, weaving, and knitting techniques. UANY braiding dramatically increased overall stiffness and strength compared to the same number of UANY unbraided. Human adipose derived stem cells (HADSC) cultured on UANY or woven and knitted 3D scaffolds aligned along local fiber direction and were >90% viable throughout 21 days. Importantly, UANY supported biochemical induction of HADSC differentiation toward smooth muscle and osteogenic lineages. Moreover, we integrated an anisotropic woven fiber mesh within a bioactive hydrogel to mimic the complex microstructure and mechanical behavior of valve tissues. Human aortic valve interstitial cells (HAVIC) and human aortic root smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were separately encapsulated within hydrogel/woven fabric composite scaffolds for generating scaffolds with anisotropic biomechanics and valve ECM like microenvironment for heart valve tissue engineering. UANY have great potential as building blocks for generating fiber-shaped tissues or tissue microstructures with complex architectures.
26996755	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent valve disease in the Western world. Recent difficulty in translating experimental results on statins to beneficial clinical effects warrants the need for understanding the role of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) in CAVD. In two-dimensional culture conditions, VICs undergo spontaneous activation similar to pathological differentiation, which intrinsically limits the use of in vitro models to study CAVD. Here, we hypothesized that a three-dimensional (3D) culture system based on naturally derived extracellular matrix polymers, mimicking the microenvironment of native valve tissue, could serve as a physiologically relevant platform to study the osteogenic differentiation of VICs.
26947381	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) progression is a highly dynamic process whereby normally fibroblastic valve interstitial cells (VIC) undergo osteogenic differentiation, maladaptive extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, structural remodeling, and tissue matrix stiffening. However, how VIC with different phenotypes dynamically affect matrix properties and how the altered matrix further affects VIC phenotypes in response to physiological and pathological conditions have not yet been determined. In this study, we develop 3D hydrogels with tunable matrix stiffness to investigate the dynamic interplay between VIC phenotypes and matrix biomechanics. We find that VIC populated within hydrogels with valve leaflet like stiffness differentiate towards myofibroblasts in osteogenic media, but surprisingly undergo osteogenic differentiation when cultured within lower initial stiffness hydrogels. VIC differentiation progressively stiffens the hydrogel microenvironment, which further upregulates both early and late osteogenic markers. These findings identify a dynamic positive feedback loop that governs acceleration of VIC calcification. Temporal stiffening of pathologically lower stiffness matrix back to normal level, or blocking the mechanosensitive RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, delays the osteogenic differentiation process. Therefore, direct ECM biomechanical modulation can affect VIC phenotypes towards and against osteogenic differentiation in 3D culture. These findings highlight the importance of the homeostatic maintenance of matrix stiffness to restrict pathological VIC differentiation.
26515875	Calcific aortic valve (AV) disease is known to be an inflammation-related process. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) have been reported to participate in several inflammatory diseases. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the HMGB1-TLR4 axis is involved in calcific AV disease, and to evaluate the effect of HMGB1, and its potential mechanisms, on the pro-osteogenic phenotype change of valvular interstitial cells (VICs).
26232165	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common heart valve disease in the Western world. We previously proposed that valvular endothelial cells (VECs) replenish injured adult valve leaflets via endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT); however, whether EndMT contributes to valvular calcification is unknown. We hypothesized that aortic VECs undergo osteogenic differentiation via an EndMT process that can be inhibited by valvular interstitial cells (VICs).
25957738	Aortic valve calcification is characterized as the active process of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs), and considered as an inflammatory disease. As an antioxidant, the anti-inflammatory activity of Lazaroid has been exhibited in various models. We hypothesized that Lazaroid U-74389G would inhibit the osteoblastic differentiation of AVICs induced by IL-1\xce\xb2.
25806689	Osteoblast differentiation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) is a key step in valve calcification, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether microRNA (miR)-204-regulated VICs differentiation through modulation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a key transcription factor for osteogenesis. Our data demonstrated that miR-204 was markedly downregulated in both human calcified aortic valves and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-stimulated aortic VICs. In vitro experiments showed that miR-204 acted as a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation by repressing Runx2 and thereby inhibiting expression of osteoblast-related genes, including alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, which were all induced by BMP-2. Luciferase reporter assays validated Runx2 as the direct target of miR-204. Furthermore, increased alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin expression after miR-204 inhibition were abolished by small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Runx2. Overall, these data suggested miR-204 as a possible molecular switch inhibiting osteoblastic transdifferentiation of human aortic VICs and targeting miR-204 may have therapeutic potential for human aortic valve calcification.
25722432	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, which affects \xe2\x89\x881% of the US population and is characterized by calcific nodule formation and stenosis of the valve. Klotho-deficient mice were used to study the molecular mechanisms of CAVD as they develop robust aortic valve (AoV) calcification. Through microarray analysis of AoV tissues from klotho-deficient and wild-type mice, increased expression of the gene encoding cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; Ptgs2) was found. COX2 activity contributes to bone differentiation and homeostasis, thus the contribution of COX2 activity to AoV calcification was assessed.
25594437	Living tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) would be a major benefit for children who require a replacement with the capacity for growth and biological integration. A persistent challenge for TEHV is accessible human cell source(s) that can mimic native valve cell phenotypes and matrix remodeling characteristics that are essential for long-term function. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (BMMSC) or adipose tissue (ADMSC) are intriguing cell sources for TEHV, but they have not been compared with pediatric human aortic valve interstitial cells (pHAVIC) in relevant 3D environments. In this study, we compared the spontaneous and induced multipotency of ADMSC and BMMSC with that of pHAVIC using different induction media within three-dimensional (3D) bioactive hybrid hydrogels with material modulus comparable to that of aortic heart valve leaflets. pHAVIC possessed some multi-lineage differentiation capacity in response to induction media, but limited to the earliest stages and much less potent than either ADMSC or BMMSC. ADMSC expressed cell phenotype markers more similar to pHAVIC when conditioned in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) containing HAVIC growth medium, while BMMSC generally expressed similar extracellular matrix remodeling characteristics to pHAVIC. Finally, we covalently attached bFGF to PEG monoacrylate linkers and further covalently immobilized in the 3D hybrid hydrogels. Immobilized bFGF upregulated vimentin expression and promoted the fibroblastic differentiation of pHAVIC, ADMSC, and BMMSC. These findings suggest that stem cells retain a heightened capacity for osteogenic differentiation in 3D culture, but can be shifted toward fibroblast differentiation through matrix tethering of bFGF. Such a strategy is likely important for utilizing stem cell sources in heart valve tissue engineering applications.
25531888	We have previously shown that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) promotes the osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We also demonstrated the detrimental role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) activation and signaling in the development and progression of aortic valve (AV) calcification. Here, we test the hypothesis that oxLDL may induce the osteoblastic differentiation of VICs via RAGE.
25528991	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the causative agents of pulpitis and previous studies have demonstrated that the LPS stimulation of human aortic valve interstitial cells induces inflammatory mediators and the gene expression of osteogenic factors. Therefore, in the present study, it was hypothesized that LPS affects the odontoblastic differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). In order to investigate this, an in vitro study using hDPCs was performed. Increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was observed in the hDPCs treated with LPS, which was more marked when the cells were costimulated with odontogenic induction medium (OM). LPS also appeared to increase the gene expression levels of dentin sialophosphoprotein and dentin matrix protein\xe2\x80\x911 and the protein expression level of dental sialoprotein in the hDPCs, particularly in combination with OM. In addition, the size and the number of nodules formed in the hDPCs exposed to OM and LPS were increased compared to those stimulated by OM alone. To determine the role of nuclear factor \xce\xbaB (NF\xe2\x80\x91\xce\xbaB) during the LPS\xe2\x80\x91induced odontoblastic differentiation of hDPCs, immunofluorescence was performed. The nuclear translocation of NF\xe2\x80\x91\xce\xbaB, induced by LPS was confirmed, suggesting its involvement in the LPS\xe2\x80\x91induced increase in odontoblastic differentiation of hDPCs. In conclusion, there may be an association between LPS stimulation, with or without OM, and odontoblastic differentiation.
25132377	Eicosanoids play various pathogenic roles in aortic valve calcification. Eicosanoids are derived from the arachidonic acid generated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). We therefore sought to determine whether PLA2s are expressed in human aortic valves and, if so, whether the expression of PLA2s is related to the expression of osteogenic molecules in these tissues.
24148916	Calcific aortic valvular disease (CAVD) is an actively regulated process characterized by the activation of specific osteogenic signaling pathways and apoptosis. We evaluated the involvement in CAVD of the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), an apoptotic molecule which induces apoptosis by interacting with the death receptor (DR)-4 and DR5, and whose activity is modulated by the decoy receptor (DcR)-1 and DcR2.
23606251	Cell-driven processes are now considered of relevance for the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis. In particular, during calcific valve degeneration, interstitial valve cells (VIC) resident in the leaflet can acquire an osteogenic/pro-calcific profile and actively contribute to matrix mineralization. The proteomic study described in this chapter is undertaken to investigate modifications in the proteome of bovine aortic VIC acquiring a calcifying phenotype. This approach can be useful to clarify cellular pathways involved in VIC pro-calcific differentiation and identify innovative therapeutic targets.
23499458	Arterial endothelial cells maintain vascular homeostasis and vessel tone in part through the secretion of nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we determined how aortic valve endothelial cells (VEC) regulate aortic valve interstitial cell (VIC) phenotype and matrix calcification through NO. Using an anchored in vitro collagen hydrogel culture system, we demonstrate that three-dimensionally cultured porcine VIC do not calcify in osteogenic medium unless under mechanical stress. Co-culture with porcine VEC, however, significantly attenuated VIC calcification through inhibition of myofibroblastic activation, osteogenic differentiation, and calcium deposition. Incubation with the NO donor DETA-NO inhibited VIC osteogenic differentiation and matrix calcification, whereas incubation with the NO blocker l-NAME augmented calcification even in 3D VIC-VEC co-culture. Aortic VEC, but not VIC, expressed endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in both porcine and human valves, which was reduced in osteogenic medium. eNOS expression was reduced in calcified human aortic valves in a side-specific manner. Porcine leaflets exposed to the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ increased osteocalcin and \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin expression. Finally, side-specific shear stress applied to porcine aortic valve leaflet endothelial surfaces increased cGMP production in VEC. Valve endothelial-derived NO is a natural inhibitor of the early phases of valve calcification and therefore may be an important regulator of valve homeostasis and pathology.
22176709	Aortic valve (AV) disease is often characterized by the formation of calcific nodules within AV leaflets that alter functional biomechanics. In vitro, formation of these nodules is associated with osteogenic differentiation and/or increased contraction and apoptosis of AV interstitial cells (AVICs), leading to growth of calcium phosphate crystal structures. In several other cell types, increased intracellular Ca(2+) has been shown to be an important part in activation of osteogenic differentiability. However, elevated intracellular Ca(2+) is known to mediate cell contraction, and has also been shown to lead to apoptosis in many cell types. Therefore, a rise in intracellular Ca(2+) may precede cellular changes that lead to calcification, and fibroblasts similar to AVICs have been shown to exhibit increases in intracellular Ca(2+) in response to mechanical strain. In this study, we hypothesized that strain induces intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation through stretch-activated calcium channels. We were also interested in assessing possible correlations between intracellular Ca(2+) increases and apoptosis in AVICs. To test our hypothesis, cultured porcine AVICs were used to assess correlates between strain, intracellular Ca(2+), and apoptosis. Ca(2+) sensitive fluorescent dyes were utilized to measure real-time intracellular Ca(2+) changes in strained AVICs. Ca(2+) changes were then correlated with AVIC apoptosis using flow cytometric Annexin V apoptosis assays. These data indicate that strain-dependent accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+) is correlated with apoptosis in AVICs. We believe that these findings indicate early mechanotransductive events that may initiate AV calcification pathways.
21863660	Aortic valve calcification is believed to involve the differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) into either a myofibroblastic or an osteoblast-like phenotype. Despite purported similarities between diseased VICs and osteoblasts, few studies have directly compared VICs and osteoblasts in side-by-side experiments. In the present study, VICs were compared against multiple osteoblastic cell types at different stages of differentiation. These findings may help to resolve whether VICs progress through a myofibroblastic phenotype before reaching an osteoblast-like stage.
21617139	Calcific aortic valve disease is associated with the differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to myofibroblast and osteoblast-like cells, particularly in the fibrosa layer of the valve. Previous studies suggested that C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) protects against calcific aortic valve disease to maintain homeostasis. We aimed to determine whether CNP inhibits VIC pathological differentiation as a mechanism to explain its protective effects.
21164078	Cardiac valvular endothelium is unique in its ability to undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, a differentiation process that is essential for valve development and has been proposed as mechanism for replenishing the interstitial cells of mature valves. We hypothesized that the valvular endothelium contains endothelial cells that are direct precursors to osteoblastic valvular interstitial cells (VICs).
21163264	Approximately 5 million people are affected with aortic valve disease (AoVD) in the United States. The most common treatment is aortic valve (AoV) replacement surgery, however, replacement valves are susceptible to failure, necessitating additional surgeries. The molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and late AoV calcification are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that genes involved in bone and cartilage development play an active role in osteogenic-like calcification in human calcific AoVD (CAVD). In an effort to define the molecular pathways involved in AoVD progression and calcification, expression of markers of valve mesenchymal progenitors, chondrogenic precursors, and osteogenic differentiation was compared in pediatric non-calcified and adult calcified AoV specimens. Valvular interstitial cell (VIC) activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) disorganization, and markers of valve mesenchymal and skeletal chondrogenic progenitor cells were observed in both pediatric and adult AoVD. However, activated BMP signaling, increased expression of cartilage and bone-type collagens, and increased expression of the osteogenic marker Runx2 are observed in adult diseased AoVs. They are not observed in the majority of pediatric diseased valves, representing a marked distinction in the molecular profile between pediatric and adult diseased AoVs. The combined evidence suggests that an actively regulated osteochondrogenic disease process underlies the pathological changes affecting AoVD progression, ultimately resulting in stenotic AoVD. Both pediatric and adult diseased AoVs express protein markers of valve mesenchymal and chondrogenic progenitor cells while adult diseased AoVs also express proteins involved in osteogenic calcification. These findings provide specific molecular indicators of AoVD progression, which may lead to identification of early disease markers and the development of potential therapeutics.
21131478	The differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to a myofibroblastic or osteoblast-like phenotype is commonly found in calcific valvular stenosis, although the molecular-level mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. Due to the role of the Rho pathway in various vascular diseases and in the expression of a myofibroblast phenotype, the present study was inspired by the hypothesis that Rho activation is involved in regulating cellular processes related to valve calcification. It was found that increased RhoA and Rho kinase (ROCK) activity was associated with increased nodule formation in VIC cultures in vitro, and intentional induction of RhoA activity led to a further increase in nodules and expression of \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin. VICs treated with ROCK inhibitors were also examined for nodule formation, proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of myofibroblastic or osteoblastic markers. ROCK inhibition dramatically reduced myofibroblast-regulated nodule formation in VIC cultures, as evidenced by a decrease in nodule number, total nodule area, \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin-positive stress fibers, apoptosis, and gene expression of myofibroblast-related phenotypic markers. Meanwhile, ROCK inhibition was less effective at reducing nodule formation associated with osteogenic activity. In fact, ROCK inhibition increased the expression of alkaline phosphatase and effected only a modest decrease in nodule number when applied to VIC cultures with higher osteogenic activity. Thus, the Rho pathway possesses a complex role in regulating the VIC phenotype and nodule formation, and it is hoped that further elucidation of these molecular-level events will lead to an improved understanding of valvular disease and identification of potential treatments.
19695258	Calcific aortic stenosis is the third leading cause of adult heart disease and the most common form of acquired valvular disease in developed countries. However, the molecular pathways leading to calcification are poorly understood. We reported two families in which heterozygous mutations in NOTCH1 caused bicuspid aortic valve and severe aortic valve calcification. NOTCH1 is part of a highly conserved signaling pathway involved in cell fate decisions, cell differentiation, and cardiac valve formation. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which NOTCH1 represses aortic valve calcification. Heterozygous Notch1-null (Notch1(+/)(-)) mice had greater than fivefold more aortic valve calcification than age- and sex-matched wildtype littermates. Inhibition of Notch signaling in cultured sheep aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) also increased calcification more than fivefold and resulted in gene expression typical of osteoblasts. We found that Notch1 normally represses the gene encoding bone morphogenic protein 2 (Bmp2) in murine aortic valves in vivo and in aortic valve cells in vitro. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bmp2 blocked the calcification induced by Notch inhibition in AVICs. These findings suggest that Notch1 signaling in aortic valve cells represses osteoblast-like calcification pathways mediated by Bmp2.
19304575	Extensive remodeling of the valve ECM in calcific aortic valve sclerosis alters its mechanical properties, but little is known about the impact of matrix mechanics on the cells within the valve interstitium. In this study, the influence of matrix stiffness in modulating calcification by valve interstitial cells (VICs), and their differentiation to pathological phenotypes was assessed.
19218344	Advanced valvular lesions often contain ectopic mesenchymal tissues, which may be elaborated by an unidentified multipotent progenitor subpopulation within the valve interstitium. The identity, frequency, and differentiation potential of the putative progenitor subpopulation are unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine whether valve interstitial cells (VICs) contain a subpopulation of multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, to measure the frequencies of the mesenchymal progenitors and osteoprogenitors, and to characterize the osteoprogenitor subpopulation because of its potential role in calcific aortic valve disease. The multilineage potential of freshly isolated and subcultured porcine aortic VICs was tested in vitro. Progenitor frequencies and self-renewal capacity were determined by limiting dilution and colony-forming unit assays. VICs were inducible to osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and myofibrogenic lineages. Osteogenic differentiation was also observed in situ in sclerotic porcine leaflets. Primary VICs had strikingly high frequencies of mesenchymal progenitors (48.0 +/- 5.7%) and osteoprogenitors (44.1 +/- 12.0%). High frequencies were maintained for up to six population doublings, but decreased after nine population doublings to 28.2 +/- 9.9% and 5.8 +/- 1.3%, for mesenchymal progenitors and osteoprogenitors, respectively. We further identified the putative osteoprogenitor subpopulation as morphologically distinct cells that occur at high frequency, self-renew, and elaborate bone matrix from single cells. These findings demonstrate that the aortic valve is rich in a mesenchyma l progenitor cell population that has strong potential to contribute to valve calcification.
17846318	Aortic valve calcification is a progressive process resembling ossification. Recent evidence indicates that the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in regulating bone deposition and resorption through the beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs). The aim of this study is to determine the level and pattern of expression of beta2-ARs in human valve interstitial cells (ICs) and assess their influence on differentiation of the cells into an osteoblast-like phenotype.
16820639	Calcific aortic valve disease is a common condition and is associated with inflammatory changes and expression of osteoblast-like cell phenotypes, but the cellular mechanisms are unclear. Recent studies identified extracellular ATP and P2Y receptor cascade as important regulators of bone remodeling, whereas its breakdown product, adenosine, is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesize that extracellular ATP and adenosine have important roles in regulating osteoblast differentiation in human valve interstitial cells, and that this can be a potential target for therapy. Method and Results- Primary cultures of human valve interstitial cells (ICs) treated for 21 days with osteogenic media, ATP, and ATP-gamma-S (a stable agonist of the P2Y receptor) revealed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (an osteoblast marker) activity and expression as measured using spectrophotometric assay and immunocytochemistry staining. Valve ICs treated with adenosine alone did not cause an increase in ALP activity; however, adenosine treatment decreased the ALP activity and expression induced by osteogenic media after 21 days of incubation. In addition, atorvastatin inhibited the activity of ALP induced by ATP in human valve ICs, and enzyme studies revealed that atorvastatin upregulated the breakdown of extracellular ATP into adenosine in human valve ICs after 24-hour treatment.
16820635	Calcific aortic valve stenosis is a common disease in the elderly and is characterized by progressive calcification and fibrous thickening of the valve, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We hypothesized that human valve interstitial cells (ICs) are able to differentiate into osteoblast-like cells through the influence of defined mediators and that this process can be modulated pharmacologically.
16359063	Tissue-engineered heart valves have the potential to overcome the limitations of present heart valve replacements. This study investigated the potential for re-seeding an acellular porcine heart valve matrix using human mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC).
